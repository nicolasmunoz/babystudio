# Target Market

## Market Overview

### Industry/Category

**Baby Content Production** — the intersection of:
- Baby product manufacturing ($88B global market)
- Commercial photography and production services
- AI-generated imagery and synthetic media

We operate in the production infrastructure layer that serves baby brands.

### Market Size

**Total Addressable Market: $4.5B – $6B**
- Global spend on creative, production, and talent for baby product imagery
- Includes: agency fees, studio/location costs, infant talent, compliance overhead, usage rights

**Market Concentration:**
- Top 10 baby CPG companies represent ~40% of market spend
- Long tail of emerging brands represents growing but fragmented segment

### Market Trends

**Driving Adoption:**
1. **E-commerce image requirements escalating** — Amazon A+, Walmart, Target all reward richer imagery; mobile-first shopping requires more visual content
2. **Personalization expectations rising** — Consumers expect to see themselves; one-size-fits-all imagery underperforms
3. **Production costs increasing** — Child labor compliance, talent rates, studio costs all trending up
4. **AI quality threshold crossed** — Photorealistic generation now possible; barrier is governance, not capability

**Creating Headwinds:**
1. **AI disclosure uncertainty** — Platform policies and regulations still evolving
2. **Brand conservatism** — Baby brands especially risk-averse; change is slow
3. **Agency relationships** — Incumbent creative partners may resist disruption

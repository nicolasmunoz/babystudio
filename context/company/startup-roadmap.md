# Startup Phase Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the key initiatives required to take babystudio from concept to market-ready. The focus is on building the foundation for customer acquisition while validating core assumptions about the market and product.

**Current State:** Company context defined, initial website exists, product capability assumed
**Target State:** Ready to engage first paying customers with a repeatable go-to-market motion

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Priority Framework

Given limited resources in startup phase, we prioritize based on:

1. **Customer proximity** — Work that gets us closer to paying customers
2. **Learning velocity** — Work that validates or invalidates assumptions quickly
3. **Foundation building** — Work that enables future scale without rework
4. **Risk reduction** — Work that addresses existential uncertainties

---

## Open Questions for Human Input

Before proceeding, clarification needed on:

1. **Production Capability:** What is the current state of the AI production capability? Can we generate sample imagery today?

2. **Visual Identity:** Do we have brand design resources? Should brand strategy include visual identity or just verbal/positioning?

3. **Timeline Pressure:** Are there external deadlines (investor meetings, launch dates, etc.) that should drive prioritization?

4. **Resource Constraints:** Beyond this AI-native company structure, what human resources are available for execution?

5. **Legal Review:** Who will review legal/compliance documents? External counsel?

6. **First Customers:** Do we have any warm leads or relationships that could become pilot customers?

7. **Pricing Validation:** Have there been any conversations that inform pricing expectations?

## Next Steps

1. Review this roadmap and provide input on open questions

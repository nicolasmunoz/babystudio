# Startup Phase Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the key initiatives required to take babystudio from concept to market-ready. The focus is on building the foundation for customer acquisition while validating core assumptions about the market and product.

**Current State:** Company context defined, initial website exists, product capability assumed
**Target State:** Ready to engage first paying customers with a repeatable go-to-market motion

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Priority Framework

Given limited resources in startup phase, we prioritize based on:

1. **Customer proximity** — Work that gets us closer to paying customers
2. **Learning velocity** — Work that validates or invalidates assumptions quickly
3. **Foundation building** — Work that enables future scale without rework
4. **Risk reduction** — Work that addresses existential uncertainties

## Open Questions for Human Input

Before proceeding, clarification needed on:

1. **Production Capability:** What is the current state of the AI production capability? Can we generate sample imagery today?

2. **Visual Identity:** Do we have brand design resources? Should brand strategy include visual identity or just verbal/positioning?

3. **Timeline Pressure:** Are there external deadlines (investor meetings, launch dates, etc.) that should drive prioritization?

4. **Resource Constraints:** Beyond this AI-native company structure, what human resources are available for execution?

5. **Legal Review:** Who will review legal/compliance documents? External counsel?

6. **First Customers:** Do we have any warm leads or relationships that could become pilot customers?

7. **Pricing Validation:** Have there been any conversations that inform pricing expectations?

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this roadmap and provide input on open questions
2. Prioritize which initiatives to tackle first
3. Create GitHub issues for approved initiatives
4. Activate CMO with first initiative assignment

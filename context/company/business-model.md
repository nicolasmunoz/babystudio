# Business Model

## Business Model Canvas

### Customer Segments

**Primary: Enterprise Baby Product Manufacturers**
- Large CPG companies (P&G, Kimberly-Clark, J&J, Nestlé, Reckitt)
- Revenue: $500M+ in baby category
- Pain: Compliance costs, localization friction, production delays
- Decision makers: VP Marketing, Creative Directors, Brand Managers

**Secondary: Emerging/DTC Baby Brands**
- Venture-backed or bootstrapped baby product companies
- Revenue: $5M–$100M
- Pain: Cannot afford traditional production complexity, forced to use poor-performing stock imagery
- Decision makers: Founders, Marketing leads, E-commerce managers

### Value Propositions

**For Enterprise:**
1. **Eliminate the "compliance tax"** — Remove the ~5x markup for welfare workers, permits, nurses, and backup babies
2. **Hyper-localization at no marginal cost** — Swap demographic representation instantly for every market (Tokyo gets Japanese baby, São Paulo gets Brazilian baby)
3. **24/7 production availability** — No scheduling dependencies, no talent aging out, no cancelled shoots
4. **Total creative control** — Exact expression (smile vs. sleep), exact grip, exact product positioning
5. **Perpetual usage rights** — No consent renegotiation every 6-12 months

**For Emerging Brands:**
1. **Access to enterprise-quality imagery** — Compete visually with P&G without P&G budgets
2. **Trust-building visuals from day one** — Stop launching with product-only images or generic stock
3. **Rapid iteration for A/B testing** — Test demographic, expression, and context variations without reshoots

### Channels

**Discovery:**
- Industry events (ABC Kids Expo, JPMA, etc.)
- LinkedIn thought leadership targeting baby brand marketers
- Trade media (licensed content, bylines in baby product industry publications)
- Referrals from creative agencies serving baby brands

**Evaluation:**
- Custom demo sessions showing brand-specific examples
- Sample pack generation (show their product with AI talent)
- Case studies with early customers

**Delivery:**
- Direct partnership model (not self-serve initially)
- Dedicated creative direction and production management
- Asset delivery via secure transfer with usage documentation

### Customer Relationships

**Enterprise:**
- High-touch partnership model
- Dedicated account management
- Quarterly business reviews
- Custom governance framework development

**Emerging Brands:**
- Guided onboarding
- Productized service tiers
- Self-serve elements as we scale

### Revenue Streams

**Primary Revenue Model: Production Services**
- Project-based pricing for asset creation
- Pricing anchored against traditional shoot costs ($2,500+ per usable image currently)
- Target: 50-70% cost reduction for comparable output

**Revenue Structure Options (to validate):**

| Model | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Per-Asset** | $/image delivered | Simple, easy to compare | Caps revenue, incentivizes fewer images |
| **Project Retainer** | Monthly/quarterly fee for production capacity | Predictable revenue, deeper partnership | Harder to sell initially |
| **Usage-Based** | Base fee + per-impression licensing | Aligns with brand value | Complex tracking |
| **Tiered Packages** | Bundles (e.g., "Launch Pack", "SKU Refresh Pack") | Easy to sell, clear deliverables | May not fit all needs |

**Initial Approach:** Per-asset pricing with project minimums to establish value, then evolve toward retainers with proven customers.

**Price Positioning:**
- Not competing on "cheapest"
- Positioned as premium service with compliance guarantee
- Price premium justified by governance, consistency, and perpetual rights

### Key Resources

**Technology:**
- Generative AI models fine-tuned for photorealistic infant imagery
- Governance systems for age-use alignment and compliance
- Asset management and delivery infrastructure

**Talent:**
- Creative direction expertise (baby product photography aesthetic)
- AI/ML engineering for model training and refinement
- Compliance and legal knowledge (child labor law, platform policies)

**Intellectual Property:**
- Library of governed synthetic infant "identities"
- Training data and model weights
- Compliance frameworks and documentation templates

### Key Activities

**Production:**
- Define constraints (age range, use case, positioning, demographic)
- Generate and curate photorealistic imagery
- Apply governance checks (age-use alignment, safety positioning)
- Deliver with usage documentation

**Quality & Compliance:**
- Maintain image quality to professional photography standards
- Keep current with platform policies (Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok)
- Document compliance for legal review by client teams

**Business Development:**
- Identify and qualify enterprise prospects
- Develop relationships with creative agencies
- Build case studies and proof points

### Key Partnerships

**Potential Partners:**
- Creative agencies serving baby brands (production partnerships)
- Amazon/retail media consultants (channel to brands optimizing PDPs)
- Baby product industry associations (credibility, access)
- Legal/compliance firms specializing in AI and advertising law

**Not Partners (Yet):**
- Stock image platforms (potential future channel, but not initial focus)
- Self-serve marketplace (requires scale we don't have)

### Cost Structure

**Fixed Costs:**
- AI infrastructure (compute, storage, model serving)
- Core team salaries (engineering, creative, business development)
- Legal/compliance (ongoing counsel, documentation)

**Variable Costs:**
- Compute per generation
- Quality assurance per project
- Sales/marketing per customer acquisition

**Cost Priorities:**
- Invest heavily in production quality (the product must be undeniably good)
- Keep sales/BD lean until product-market fit is proven
- Compliance as investment, not expense

## Summary

**In one sentence:** We help baby product brands produce trust-building imagery without real infants by providing AI-generated talent and compliance-first production infrastructure, capturing value through premium production services priced against the true cost of traditional baby photoshoots.

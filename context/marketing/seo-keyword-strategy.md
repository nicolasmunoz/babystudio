# SEO Keyword Strategy

This document defines babystudio's organic search strategy for the blog and website. It identifies target keyword clusters, maps keywords to content types and funnel stages, establishes on-page SEO standards, and provides a framework for tracking and measuring organic search performance.

SEO is a compounding channel. Every piece of content that ranks creates durable, recurring traffic without ongoing spend. For a pre-revenue company selling a specialized B2B product, organic search builds a moat that paid channels cannot replicate.

**Companion documents:**
- Channel Strategy (`context/marketing/channel-strategy.md`) -- blog/website channel strategy and resource allocation
- Editorial Calendar (`context/marketing/editorial-calendar.md`) -- content scheduling and production workflow
- Content Pillars (`context/marketing/content-pillars.md`) -- topical framework guiding keyword selection
- Audience Segments (`context/marketing/audience-segments.md`) -- who we are targeting with search content
- Messaging Framework (`context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`) -- how we communicate value
- Brand Guidelines (`context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`) -- voice, terminology, writing standards

## SEO Strategy Overview

### Strategic Position

babystudio operates in a niche at the intersection of three search categories:
1. **Baby product marketing and photography** -- established search volume, moderate competition
2. **AI-generated product imagery** -- growing search volume, increasing competition
3. **AI content compliance and governance** -- emerging search volume, low competition

Our SEO strategy targets the overlap between these categories, where search intent aligns directly with our value proposition and competition is manageable for a new domain.

### SEO Goals

| Timeframe | Goal | Metrics |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 3 months | Establish keyword targeting foundation | 10+ blog posts published targeting specific clusters. 2-5 keywords on page 1-3. |
| 6 months | Build organic traffic baseline | 500-1,500 monthly organic sessions. 10-20 keywords ranking page 1-2. 5+ keywords on page 1. |
| 12 months | Organic as a meaningful pipeline channel | 3,000-8,000 monthly organic sessions. 30-50 keywords ranking. Organic contributing 15-25% of inbound leads. |

### Strategic Principles

1. **Target the intersection.** The highest-value keywords sit where baby product marketing meets AI imagery meets compliance. General "AI photography" keywords are too competitive and too broad. Category-specific long-tail keywords have lower volume but higher conversion intent.

2. **Win on depth, not authority.** As a new domain, we cannot outrank established publications on head terms through domain authority alone. We win by creating the most thorough, most specific, most useful content on topics where no one has written definitively. Depth compensates for domain age.

3. **Match search intent precisely.** A blog post that ranks but does not match the searcher's intent generates traffic that does not convert. Every keyword target includes an intent classification, and the content format matches that intent.

4. **Build topical authority through clusters.** Search engines reward sites that demonstrate comprehensive expertise on a topic. Our cluster model (pillar pages + supporting content + internal links) builds topical authority faster than scattered, unrelated posts.

## Content Gap Analysis

These are keyword opportunities where competitors likely rank but babystudio does not yet have content. Gaps are identified by competitor type.

### Gaps vs. Traditional Photography Providers

Traditional photography studios and talent agencies rank for:
- "baby product photography near me" -- We do not compete on local intent, but we can capture the audience searching for alternatives
- "baby model agency" -- Resource content about the process, with a pivot to AI alternatives
- "commercial baby photography" -- Our entry is the cost and compliance comparison
- "newborn photography for products" -- Category-specific content with our governance angle

**Opportunity:** Create comparison content that meets the searcher at their current intent (evaluating traditional production) and introduces AI as an alternative. These searchers are in our buying journey at the Problem-Aware stage.

### Gaps vs. General AI Photography Platforms

Platforms like Bria, Generated Photos, and others rank for:
- "AI model generator" -- Too broad for us, but "AI baby model generator" is territory we own
- "AI product photography" -- We compete here with baby-specific expertise
- "synthetic media for brands" -- Our governance angle is the differentiator
- "AI generated humans for marketing" -- Baby-specific is our niche within this space

**Opportunity:** Create content that addresses the baby-specific limitations of general AI platforms. The keyword "AI generated baby images" is where general platforms fail to provide adequate governance -- that is our gap to fill.

### Gaps vs. E-commerce Content Platforms

Amazon optimization tools and e-commerce content platforms rank for:
- "product listing optimization" -- We enter through baby-specific angles
- "Amazon A+ content examples" -- Baby product-specific examples are underserved
- "product photography for Amazon" -- Baby-specific compliance and imagery guidance
- "e-commerce image optimization" -- Conversion data specific to baby products

**Opportunity:** Create baby product-specific versions of popular e-commerce optimization content. The general guides exist; the baby-specific guides do not.

---

## On-Page SEO Guidelines

Every piece of content published on babystudio.com should follow these on-page optimization standards.

### Title Tag

- **Format:** Primary Keyword: Descriptive Subtitle | babystudio
- **Length:** 50-60 characters (including brand)
- **Keyword placement:** Primary keyword should appear within the first 40 characters
- **Brand tag:** Include "| babystudio" at the end for brand recognition in SERPs
- **Examples:**
  - "Baby Product Photography Cost: Complete Breakdown | babystudio"
  - "AI Disclosure Requirements for Product Imagery | babystudio"
  - "$500 vs. $2,500: Baby Product Image Cost Comparison | babystudio"

### Meta Description

- **Length:** 140-155 characters
- **Structure:** Value statement + specific detail + call to action
- **Include:** Primary keyword naturally, a specific number or data point when possible
- **CTA language:** "Learn how," "See the comparison," "Get the complete guide"
- **Examples:**
  - "Traditional baby shoots cost $2,500+ per image after compliance. Learn what drives the cost and how governed AI imagery reduces it by 50-70%."
  - "AI disclosure policies differ across Amazon, Meta, and Google. Get the platform-by-platform guide for baby product brands."

### Heading Structure

- **H1:** One per page. Matches or closely mirrors the title tag. Contains primary keyword.
- **H2:** Major sections. Each should address a distinct sub-topic. Include secondary keywords where natural.
- **H3:** Sub-sections within H2 blocks. Use for detailed breakdowns, lists, or supporting points.
- **H4:** Use sparingly. Only for detailed sub-sub-sections in very long content.
- **Guidelines:**
  - Every H2 should be understandable out of context (for scanning readers)
  - Do not skip heading levels (no H1 to H3 without an H2)
  - Use headings to create a logical outline -- if someone reads only the headings, they should understand the article's structure

### Keyword Usage

- **Primary keyword:** Include in H1, first paragraph, at least one H2, and conclusion. Do not force. Natural inclusion is always better than keyword stuffing.
- **Secondary keywords:** Include in H2s and body text where natural. 2-4 secondary keywords per post.
- **Keyword density:** No target density. Write naturally. If the keyword appears in every paragraph, it is too much. If it appears only once, it may be too little. Use judgment.
- **Semantic keywords:** Include related terms and synonyms that a thorough article on the topic would naturally contain. Search engines understand semantic relationships.
- **Do not:**
  - Stuff keywords into sentences where they do not fit naturally
  - Use the exact keyword phrase in every heading
  - Sacrifice readability for keyword inclusion
  - Use keywords in ways that violate our brand guidelines (e.g., "fake baby photos" even if it has search volume)

### Image Optimization

- **Alt text:** Describe the image content accurately. Include the primary keyword if it describes the image naturally.
  - Good: "Cost breakdown comparison between traditional baby photoshoot and AI-generated baby product imagery"
  - Bad: "baby product photography cost baby product photography pricing AI photography"
- **File names:** Descriptive, hyphen-separated. "baby-product-photography-cost-comparison.jpg" not "IMG_4582.jpg"
- **File size:** Compress images to under 200KB where possible without visible quality loss
- **Format:** WebP preferred, JPEG for photographs, PNG for graphics with text

### Internal Linking

- **Minimum links per post:** 3 internal links to other babystudio blog posts or pages
- **Anchor text:** Use descriptive, keyword-relevant anchor text. Not "click here" or "read more."
  - Good: "Our governance framework addresses these compliance concerns"
  - Bad: "You can learn more about compliance here"
- **Link placement:** Within the body text where contextually relevant. At least one link in the first half of the article and one in the second half.
- **Link to pillar pages:** Every supporting article in a cluster should link to the cluster's pillar page. Every pillar page should link to its supporting articles.
- **Cross-cluster links:** When a post in one cluster references a topic in another cluster, link to the relevant post in that cluster.

### URL Structure

- **Format:** babystudio.com/blog/primary-keyword-phrase
- **Length:** Keep URLs short (3-5 words after /blog/)
- **Do not include:** Dates, numbers (unless part of the keyword), stop words (a, the, in, of)
- **Examples:**
  - babystudio.com/blog/baby-product-photography-cost
  - babystudio.com/blog/ai-disclosure-requirements
  - babystudio.com/blog/ai-vs-live-talent-comparison

## Content Update Strategy

Existing content that is already indexed has an advantage over new content. Updating high-potential posts is often more effective than publishing new ones.

### When to Update Content

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Post ranks position 5-15 for target keyword | Update with additional depth, data, and internal links to push toward position 1-3 |
| Post has declining traffic over 2+ months | Refresh with current data, expanded sections, and improved headlines |
| New data or proof points become available | Add new evidence to relevant posts |
| Competitor publishes stronger content on the same keyword | Audit and improve our post to be more comprehensive |
| Search intent shifts (SERP analysis shows different content types ranking) | Restructure content to match current intent |

### Update Checklist

- [ ] Review current rankings and identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Analyze top-ranking competitors for the target keyword
- [ ] Identify content gaps compared to competitors
- [ ] Update with new data, examples, and depth
- [ ] Refresh title tag and meta description if needed
- [ ] Add new internal links to recently published content
- [ ] Update the publication date (if significant changes)
- [ ] Re-submit URL to Google Search Console for reindexing

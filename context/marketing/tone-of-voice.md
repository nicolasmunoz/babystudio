# Tone of Voice Guide

This document defines how babystudio sounds across every channel, audience, and context. It builds on the voice characteristics established in the Brand Guidelines and provides practical, actionable guidance for anyone writing as babystudio.

The voice is who we are. The tone is how we adjust based on who we are talking to and where. The voice stays constant. The tone flexes.

**Companion documents:**
- Brand Guidelines (`context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`) -- brand personality, voice characteristics, writing dos/don'ts, terminology
- Messaging Framework (`context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`) -- what we say; this document governs how we say it

---

## Voice Dimensions

babystudio's voice sits at a specific position on each of these spectrums. These positions are our defaults. Tone modifiers (detailed later in this document) shift along these spectrums based on context, but the voice never moves to the extremes.

### Formal ------[---X---]------ Casual

**Position: Center-formal.** We are professional but not stiff. We write in complete, considered sentences. We do not use slang, excessive contractions, or conversational filler. But we also do not write like a legal brief or an academic paper. We sound like a senior executive having a substantive conversation -- articulate, prepared, and grounded, but not performing formality.

*Sounds like:* A respected colleague presenting to the leadership team.
*Does not sound like:* A legal disclaimer or a brand trying to seem relatable.

### Serious ------[---X---]------ Playful

**Position: Center-serious.** We take our work seriously. We deal with infant imagery, compliance, trust, and governance -- subjects that require gravity. But we are not grim. We allow ourselves measured warmth, occasional wit, and human moments. We never make light of the responsibility we carry, but we do not treat every sentence as though the fate of the world depends on it.

*Sounds like:* A surgeon who can make patients comfortable before a procedure.
*Does not sound like:* A legal warning or a brand mascot.

### Technical ------[---X---]------ Accessible

**Position: Center-accessible.** We make complex topics understandable without dumbing them down. We use industry language when our audience expects it but explain terms when there is any doubt. We are specific and precise -- we name the problem, quantify the impact, and describe the solution in concrete terms -- but we do not hide behind jargon or technical complexity.

*Sounds like:* A knowledgeable advisor explaining options to a smart non-expert.
*Does not sound like:* An engineer writing documentation or a children's book explaining technology.

### Reserved ------[---X---]------ Enthusiastic

**Position: Center-reserved.** We are confident and assertive without being excitable. We believe in what we do and we say so directly. But we do not use exclamation points, hyperbolic language, or the breathless tone of a product launch press release. Our confidence is quiet and grounded. When we have something impressive to share, we state it plainly and let the facts carry the weight.

*Sounds like:* An experienced professional who has seen results before and expects to see them again.
*Does not sound like:* A startup pitch competition or a late-night infomercial.

### Authoritative ------[--X----]------ Collaborative

**Position: Slightly authoritative.** We are experts in this space, and we lead with that expertise. We do not ask permission to have a point of view. When the evidence supports a claim, we make the claim. But we temper authority with collaboration -- we position ourselves as partners, not lecturers. We share knowledge to empower, not to impress. We listen as well as we speak.

*Sounds like:* A trusted advisor with a clear recommendation, open to discussion.
*Does not sound like:* A professor grading your homework or a consultant who just agrees with everything.

## Base Voice Characteristics

These six characteristics define the babystudio voice. They are always on, regardless of channel, audience, or content type. Each characteristic includes a description, what it sounds like in practice, and examples.

### 1. Clear

We use plain language. Every sentence is understandable on first read. We do not make the reader work to figure out what we mean. Clarity is not simplicity -- we can communicate complex ideas clearly. We just refuse to communicate simple ideas in complex ways.

**In practice:**
- One idea per sentence when possible
- Concrete language over abstract language
- Specific examples over vague descriptions
- Define terms when there is any ambiguity

**Example:**
- Instead of: "Our platform leverages cutting-edge generative AI capabilities to produce synthetic visual assets that meet the highest standards of photorealistic fidelity."
- Write: "We produce photorealistic baby imagery using AI. The quality matches professional photography."

### 2. Direct

We get to the point. We state our position, then support it. We do not bury the lead in a paragraph of context-setting. When someone reads our content, they know what we think and why within the first few lines.

**In practice:**
- Lead with the conclusion or key insight
- Support with evidence, not the other way around
- Use active voice as the default
- Cut preamble and throat-clearing sentences

**Example:**
- Instead of: "Many baby product brands today are finding themselves at a crossroads when it comes to the production of infant imagery for their marketing materials, as traditional approaches continue to face mounting challenges."
- Write: "Traditional baby photoshoots are getting more expensive, more complex, and less reliable. There is a better approach."

### 3. Measured

We do not use superlatives carelessly. We qualify claims when appropriate. We sound like professionals who have considered what they are saying, not marketers trying to generate excitement. When we make a strong claim, it is because the evidence supports it -- and we show the evidence.

**In practice:**
- Avoid "best," "most," "only" unless provably true
- Use specific numbers over vague claims ("50-70% cost reduction" not "massive savings")
- Acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs honestly
- Let results speak rather than adjectives

**Example:**
- Instead of: "babystudio is the most revolutionary solution in the baby imagery space, delivering unparalleled quality that will completely transform your marketing."
- Write: "babystudio delivers photorealistic infant imagery at 50-70% lower cost than traditional production, with governance documentation included in every asset."

### 4. Human

Despite being an AI-native company, our voice is distinctly human. We use conversational structure. We acknowledge tension and complexity. We speak as people who understand other people's problems -- not as a technology that has solved everything.

**In practice:**
- Address the reader directly ("you," "your brand," "your team")
- Acknowledge pain points before presenting solutions
- Use conversational transitions, not corporate connectors
- Show that we understand the real-world context of decisions

**Example:**
- Instead of: "The solution eliminates operational inefficiencies in the baby content production pipeline through AI-driven automation."
- Write: "If you have ever watched a product launch slip because a baby would not stop crying during the shoot, you understand why we built this."

### 5. Assertive

We believe in what we do and we say so. We do not hedge unnecessarily. When we have a clear advantage, we state it. When the data supports a claim, we make the claim. Assertiveness is not arrogance -- it is the confidence that comes from knowing your subject deeply.

**In practice:**
- State positions clearly ("We believe..." not "It could be argued that...")
- Make direct comparisons when they serve the reader
- Do not apologize for being AI-native
- Use declarative sentences more than conditional ones

**Example:**
- Instead of: "It's possible that AI-generated imagery could potentially offer some advantages over traditional photography in certain situations."
- Write: "AI-generated infant imagery outperforms traditional production on cost, speed, and compliance documentation. Here is how."

### 6. Trust-forward

Trust is our product. Every piece of communication reinforces that we take the responsibility of creating infant imagery seriously. We lead with governance, compliance, and safety -- not as marketing angles but as genuine commitments. We earn trust through transparency, not through claims about trustworthiness.

**In practice:**
- Lead with governance when introducing our product
- Be transparent about what we are (AI-generated imagery)
- Never obscure the synthetic nature of our output
- Discuss compliance proactively, not defensively
- Show the safeguards, do not just assert their existence

**Example:**
- Instead of: "Our industry-leading trust framework ensures the highest levels of safety and compliance."
- Write: "Every image includes age-use alignment verification, safe positioning checks, and platform-specific disclosure guidance. Here is what each one means and why it matters."

---

## Tone Modifiers by Context

The base voice stays constant. These modifiers adjust emphasis, formality, and energy based on where the content appears.

### Website Copy

**Adjustments from base:**
- Slightly more assertive -- the website needs to make a clear case quickly
- Shorter sentences and paragraphs -- scanning behavior dominates
- More use of subheadings and structural clarity
- Lead with outcomes, support with specifics
- Trust-forward elements should be visible, not buried

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Direct, assertive, clear
**Characteristics to moderate:** Human (less conversational on hero sections, more on deeper pages)

**Example tone:**
- Homepage hero: "Governed AI imagery for baby product brands. Photorealistic. Compliant. Delivered in days."
- Product page: "Every asset includes age-use alignment verification, safe positioning checks, and disclosure guidance for major platforms. Your legal team reviews documentation, not ambiguity."
- About page: "We started with a question: why is baby product imagery the most expensive, unpredictable line item in a brand's marketing budget? The answer led us to build something new."

### Email -- Cold Outreach

**Adjustments from base:**
- More human and conversational -- you are earning the right to be read
- Direct but not aggressive -- respect for the reader's time
- Lead with a relevant pain point, not your company
- Shorter than other formats -- every sentence must earn its place
- One clear call to action

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Human, direct, measured
**Characteristics to moderate:** Authoritative (establish credibility without lecturing), assertive (suggest, do not push)

**Example tone:**
"The average baby photoshoot costs $2,500+ per usable image after you account for welfare workers, permits, and backup babies. Most of that cost has nothing to do with the quality of the final image. We have been working with [similar brands] to reduce that cost by 50-70% using governed AI imagery -- same quality, full compliance documentation, delivered in days. Would it be useful to see a sample set with your product?"

### Email -- Nurture Sequence

**Adjustments from base:**
- More educational and value-forward -- give before you ask
- Build narrative across multiple touches
- Slightly warmer and more relational than cold outreach
- Reference previous interactions or content when possible
- Patient -- the goal is building understanding, not forcing a decision

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Human, trust-forward, clear
**Characteristics to moderate:** Assertive (educate rather than sell in early nurture stages)

**Example tone:**
"Last week we shared how the compliance tax inflates baby production costs by 5x. This week, we want to talk about what happens after the shoot: usage rights. Most infant talent contracts expire in 6-12 months. When they do, you have two options: renegotiate (expensive) or reshoot (more expensive). There is a third option. Here is how perpetual usage rights work with AI-generated imagery."

### Email -- Newsletter

**Adjustments from base:**
- Most human and conversational of all email formats
- Can include industry perspective, opinion, and point of view
- Warmer opening, more personality allowed
- Educational with a clear takeaway
- Positions babystudio as a knowledgeable voice in the category, not just a vendor

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Human, assertive, trust-forward
**Characteristics to moderate:** Measured (can be slightly more opinionated in newsletter format)

**Example tone:**
"A major baby brand just pulled their entire holiday campaign two weeks before launch because the talent agency could not secure usage rights extensions in time. This is not rare. It happens more often than anyone admits publicly. The usage rights model for infant talent is broken, and it costs brands millions in wasted production and missed launch windows. Here is what is changing."

### Social Media -- LinkedIn

**Adjustments from base:**
- More opinionated and perspective-driven -- LinkedIn rewards a point of view
- Shorter paragraphs, each carrying weight
- Opening line must stop the scroll -- start with a surprising fact, a contrarian take, or a direct statement
- More personal voice (founder perspective when applicable)
- End with engagement prompt or clear takeaway, not a hard sell

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Assertive, direct, human
**Characteristics to moderate:** Formal (slightly more casual than website, still professional)

**Example tone:**
"Baby photoshoots have a 30-40% failure rate. Not because of bad photographers. Because babies are babies. They cry. They sleep. They get sick the morning of the shoot. And the backup baby? Same odds. The industry has accepted this as the cost of doing business for decades. It does not have to be."

### Sales Conversations and Materials

**Adjustments from base:**
- Most collaborative -- sales is a two-way conversation
- Lead with questions and understanding before solutions
- Highly specific to the prospect's situation
- Use proof points and evidence generously
- Confident but never pushy -- we believe in our product and we let results make the case

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Human, trust-forward, measured
**Characteristics to moderate:** Assertive (listen more, prescribe less, especially early in conversation)

**Example tone:**
"Before I walk through what we do, I want to understand your current production process. How are you producing infant imagery today? What is working well? Where are the pain points? That context helps me show you the parts of our platform that are most relevant to your situation."

### Customer Support

**Adjustments from base:**
- Most warm and patient of all contexts
- Solution-oriented -- focus on resolving, not explaining
- Acknowledge the issue before addressing it
- Clear, step-by-step communication
- Never defensive, even if the concern is based on a misunderstanding

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Human, clear, trust-forward
**Characteristics to moderate:** Assertive (support is about serving, not leading), direct (be thorough rather than brief)

**Example tone:**
"Thank you for flagging this. I can see why the age depiction in that image raised a concern -- age-use alignment is something we take seriously, and you are right to question it. Let me review the governance check for this asset and get back to you with specifics within the hour."

### Internal Documents

**Adjustments from base:**
- Most direct and efficient -- internal audiences do not need to be sold
- Can use more technical and operational language
- Less need for warmth or persuasion
- Focus on clarity, accuracy, and actionability
- Acceptable to be more blunt about challenges and limitations

**Characteristics to emphasize:** Direct, clear, measured
**Characteristics to moderate:** Human (less conversational), trust-forward (less emphasis on governance narrative for internal readers)

**Example tone:**
"Q3 production volume: 2,400 images across 12 enterprise accounts. Quality consistency score: 94%. Two governance flags -- both resolved within SLA. Localization variant output increased 3x without additional production resources."

---

## Tone Modifiers by Audience

### Enterprise Executive (Enterprise Emma)

**Tone adjustments:**
- More formal by half a step -- these buyers expect polished communication
- Data-driven -- lead with numbers, metrics, and quantified outcomes
- Risk-aware -- acknowledge risks and explain how they are mitigated
- Strategic framing -- connect to business outcomes, not features
- Patient -- enterprise buying cycles are long; do not rush
- Governance-forward -- compliance is often their primary concern

**Words that resonate:** Governance, risk mitigation, documentation, compliance, ROI, efficiency, operational, scalable, enterprise-grade, validated.

**Words that alienate:** Disruptive, revolutionary, game-changing, hack, startup, beta, experiment.

**Example:**
"Our governance framework addresses the compliance requirements that enterprise legal teams evaluate during vendor review. Every asset includes documentation for age-use alignment, safe positioning, platform-specific disclosure, and perpetual usage rights -- designed for the review processes your team already has in place."

### DTC Founder (Startup Sam)

**Tone adjustments:**
- More direct and scrappy -- founders value efficiency in communication
- ROI-focused -- every dollar matters, show the math
- Action-oriented -- what can they do right now?
- Slightly more casual -- still professional, but less corporate
- Aspirational -- they want to compete with bigger brands
- Practical -- they do not have teams to manage complex processes

**Words that resonate:** Cost-effective, fast, iterate, test, compete, launch, scale, accessible, simple, results.

**Words that alienate:** Enterprise-grade (implies expensive), comprehensive framework (implies complexity), governance (sounds heavy unless tied to "handled for you").

**Example:**
"You are spending $10K+ per baby shoot and getting 4-5 usable images. We deliver the same quality at $500-$1,500 per image with compliance handled. That is your next three product launches covered for the cost of one traditional shoot."

### Agency Creative (Agency Alex)

**Tone adjustments:**
- More creative and capability-focused -- agencies think in terms of what they can do
- Partnership language -- we are with them, not above them
- Respect for their craft -- never imply AI replaces creative skill
- New business framing -- how does this help them win accounts?
- Practical production language -- turnaround, deliverables, integration

**Words that resonate:** Partnership, capability, creative direction, client value, production, deliverables, innovative, pitch, win.

**Words that alienate:** Replace, automate, eliminate (when referring to agency work), cheaper (implies devaluing their services), self-serve (implies they are not needed).

**Example:**
"Your creative direction stays yours. We handle the production and governance layer so you can deliver baby product imagery to your clients without the unpredictability of live infant shoots. Think of it as adding a new production capability to your team -- one that makes your client pitches stronger."

---

## Tone Modifiers by Funnel Stage

### Awareness Stage

**Tone goal:** Educate and create resonance with the pain point. The reader may not know babystudio exists and may not yet realize there is a better way.

**Tone adjustments:**
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Educational and empathetic -- show you understand their world
- Thought leadership orientation -- share perspective, not product details
- Avoid selling; focus on earning attention and trust
- Create recognition: "That is exactly my situation"

**Example:**
"The average baby product shoot involves 14 separate compliance requirements before a camera is turned on. Welfare workers, permits, nursing staff, backup talent, consent documentation, platform-specific releases. By the time you factor in the compliance tax, you have spent 5x what the photography alone costs. And if the baby cries through the 20-minute window, you start over."

### Consideration Stage

**Tone goal:** Provide evidence and comparison. The reader knows the problem and is evaluating options. They want to understand how babystudio compares.

**Tone adjustments:**
- More comparative and evidence-based
- Specific about capabilities, pricing, and differentiation
- Address objections proactively
- Use proof points generously
- Balanced -- acknowledge where traditional or other approaches have strengths

**Example:**
"Three approaches exist for baby product imagery: traditional shoots, stock photography, and AI-generated production. Traditional delivers quality but at $2,500+ per image with unpredictable timelines. Stock is fast but generic -- no product integration, no demographic control. babystudio delivers product-integrated, governed imagery at $500-$1,500 per image, in days. Here is how the quality compares."

### Decision Stage

**Tone goal:** Build confidence in the decision. The reader is close to committing and needs reassurance that this is the right move.

**Tone adjustments:**
- More confident and reassuring
- Specific about process, onboarding, and what happens next
- Address remaining concerns directly and definitively
- Reference similar customers or comparable outcomes
- Make the next step clear and low-risk

**Example:**
"Our pilot program is designed for exactly this stage. You choose a product, we produce a sample set with full governance documentation, and your team evaluates quality, compliance, and workflow integration. No long-term commitment required. Most teams move to ongoing production within 30 days of their pilot because the results speak for themselves."

### Post-Sale Stage

**Tone goal:** Support, partner, and deepen the relationship. The customer has committed and needs to feel confident they made the right decision.

**Tone adjustments:**
- Most warm and collaborative
- Supportive and responsive
- Forward-looking -- what else can we do together?
- Celebrates shared wins without being performative
- Proactive about potential issues or optimizations

**Example:**
"Your Q2 production is complete -- 120 images across three product lines, all with full governance documentation. The demographic variant set for the APAC expansion is ready for your regional team's review. A few things we noticed that might be useful for your next brief: the seated positioning generated stronger composition for the infant carrier imagery. Worth considering for the Q3 series."

---

## Example Rewrites

These examples show how generic marketing language becomes babystudio language. Each demonstrates one or more voice characteristics in action.

### Example 1: Hero Headline

**Generic:** "The Future of Baby Product Photography Is Here"
**babystudio:** "Governed AI imagery for baby product brands. Photorealistic. Compliant. Delivered in days."

*Why:* The generic version is vague and hyperbolic. The babystudio version states what we do, what it delivers, and how fast -- in that order. Direct, clear, measured.

### Example 2: Product Description

**Generic:** "Our cutting-edge AI technology creates stunning baby images that will transform your marketing."
**babystudio:** "We produce photorealistic infant imagery using AI-generated talent. Your product, held correctly, used safely, represented across any demographic -- with governance documentation included in every asset."

*Why:* Removes jargon ("cutting-edge"), removes empty adjectives ("stunning"), removes vague promises ("transform"). Adds specificity about what the imagery actually includes. Trust-forward by leading with governance.

### Example 3: Value Proposition

**Generic:** "Save money on baby photoshoots with our affordable AI solution."
**babystudio:** "Traditional baby shoots cost $2,500+ per usable image after compliance overhead. babystudio delivers at $500-$1,500 per image with perpetual rights included. That is a 50-70% cost reduction before you factor in eliminated scheduling risk and renegotiation costs."

*Why:* Replaces vague cost claims with specific numbers. Shows the comparison rather than asserting affordability. Measured and evidence-based.

### Example 4: Social Media Post

**Generic:** "Exciting news! We just launched an amazing new AI tool for baby brands! Check it out! #AI #BabyProducts #Innovation"
**babystudio:** "Baby photoshoots have a 30-40% failure rate. Not because of bad photographers. Because babies are babies. We built babystudio to remove the unpredictability from the equation -- not the quality."

*Why:* Removes exclamation points, removes hashtag spam, removes empty adjectives. Starts with a surprising fact. States the problem, then the solution. Human and assertive without being breathless.

### Example 5: Email Subject Line

**Generic:** "You Won't Believe What AI Can Do for Baby Brands!"
**babystudio:** "The 20-minute window is costing you more than you think"

*Why:* Removes clickbait language. References a specific pain point the reader recognizes. Creates curiosity through relevance, not hype.

### Example 6: Case Study Opening

**Generic:** "Learn how Company X used our revolutionary platform to achieve incredible results in their baby product marketing."
**babystudio:** "Company X was spending $180K per quarter on baby product imagery and missing 40% of their launch windows due to production delays. Twelve months later, the same volume costs $65K, every launch ships on time, and their legal team approves assets in half the time."

*Why:* Removes "revolutionary" and "incredible." Opens with specific, quantified before-and-after results. Shows, does not tell. Measured and direct.

### Example 7: Objection Response

**Generic:** "Don't worry, our AI produces images that are indistinguishable from real photos!"
**babystudio:** "Quality is the first question every customer asks, and it should be. Rather than tell you the quality is comparable, we produce a sample set with your actual product. That way your team evaluates with their own eyes against their own standards."

*Why:* Replaces dismissive reassurance with a concrete next step. Acknowledges the concern as valid. Shows confidence through action, not assertion. Human and trust-forward.

### Example 8: Partnership Pitch

**Generic:** "Partner with us and take your agency to the next level with the power of AI!"
**babystudio:** "Your creative direction stays yours. We handle AI talent production and governance. Your clients get better results, faster delivery, and lower costs -- and you get a new capability to pitch in every baby brand conversation."

*Why:* Removes vague empowerment language. Specifies exactly what each party does. Focuses on client value, not agency transformation. Collaborative and direct.

### Example 9: Compliance Messaging

**Generic:** "We take compliance very seriously and ensure all our images meet the highest standards."
**babystudio:** "Every asset includes three governance checks: age-use alignment (the depicted infant age matches appropriate product use), safe positioning (the infant is shown in a realistic, safe interaction), and disclosure readiness (documentation for platform-specific AI content policies). These are not optional add-ons. They are built into every production run."

*Why:* Replaces "take seriously" vagueness with specific governance steps. Names and explains each check. Demonstrates compliance through detail, not claims. Trust-forward and clear.

### Example 10: CTA (Call to Action)

**Generic:** "Get started today! Request a free demo!"
**babystudio:** "See your product with babystudio imagery. We will produce a sample set -- no commitment, no cost for the initial evaluation."

*Why:* Replaces generic urgency with a specific, valuable offer. "See your product" is concrete. "No commitment, no cost" is reassuring without being desperate. Direct and measured.

### Example 11: About Us

**Generic:** "We are a team of passionate innovators who are revolutionizing the baby product industry with our groundbreaking AI technology."
**babystudio:** "We started with a question: why is baby product imagery the most expensive, unpredictable production line item in marketing? The answer -- the 20-minute window, crying babies, compliance overhead, expiring rights -- led us to build a different kind of production infrastructure. One built on AI talent and governed from the ground up."

*Why:* Replaces self-congratulatory language with a narrative. Opens with the problem we noticed. Shows the path from problem to solution. Human and assertive.

### Example 12: Feature Announcement

**Generic:** "We're thrilled to announce our exciting new demographic flexibility feature that will change everything!"
**babystudio:** "New: generate demographically specific imagery for any market from a single brief. Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Lagos -- same product, same quality, same governance, no additional production cost."

*Why:* Removes emotional filler ("thrilled," "exciting," "change everything"). States the capability, gives specific examples, and notes the business impact. Clear, direct, measured.

## Sentence Structure Preferences

### Length

- **Target average:** 15-20 words per sentence
- **Range:** 5-30 words. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Rule:** If a sentence exceeds 30 words, break it into two or restructure
- **Short sentences for impact.** They create rhythm. They emphasize points. They break up density.
- **Longer sentences for explanation**, connecting ideas with clear logic and minimal subordinate clauses.

### Complexity

- **One idea per sentence** as the default
- **Two ideas per sentence** when they are directly related and one depends on the other
- **Never three ideas in one sentence** -- split or restructure
- **Front-load the important information** -- put the subject and verb early

### Active vs. Passive Voice

- **Active voice by default.** "babystudio delivers governed imagery" not "Governed imagery is delivered by babystudio."
- **Passive voice is acceptable when:**
  - The actor is genuinely unknown or unimportant: "Usage rights are included in every asset"
  - The emphasis should be on the object: "Every image is governed for age-use alignment"
  - The sentence flows better in context (rare, but sometimes true)
- **Never use passive voice to avoid responsibility or to sound more formal**

### Structural Patterns

- **Statement, then support.** Make the claim, then provide the evidence.
- **Problem, then solution.** Name the pain, then show the relief.
- **Specific, then general.** Start with the concrete example, then zoom out to the principle.
- **Avoid throat-clearing.** Do not open with "It is important to note that..." or "As we all know..." Just say the thing.

---

## Paragraph Structure

### Length

- **2-4 sentences per paragraph** as the default for web and email content
- **1 sentence paragraphs** are acceptable for emphasis or transitions
- **5+ sentence paragraphs** only for detailed explanations in long-form content (case studies, white papers)
- **Never write a wall of text.** If a paragraph fills a screen on mobile, it is too long.

### Structure

- **Lead with the insight, not the setup.** The first sentence of every paragraph should carry the most important information.
- **One topic per paragraph.** If you are making two points, use two paragraphs.
- **End strong.** The last sentence should either set up the next paragraph or deliver a conclusion worth remembering.

### Rhythm

- **Vary paragraph length.** A sequence of same-length paragraphs creates monotony.
- **Use short paragraphs after long ones** to provide breathing room.
- **Lists and bullets** break up text and improve scannability -- use them when presenting three or more related items.

---

- **Safe positioning** -- include "(ensuring infants are depicted in safe, realistic product interactions)" on first mention
- **The compliance tax** -- include "(the ~5x cost markup from welfare workers, permits, nurses, and backup babies)" on first mention
- **The 20-minute window** -- include "(the legal restriction on infant camera time)" on first mention
- **Governed imagery** -- include "(images produced with our compliance and safety framework applied)" on first mention
- **AI talent / synthetic talent** -- context usually makes meaning clear, but define if audience is unfamiliar with AI content

### Terms We Avoid Entirely

These either confuse our audience, misrepresent what we do, or carry negative connotations:

- **Deepfake** -- loaded with negative connotation, inaccurate for our use case
- **Synthetic media** (in external comms) -- sounds clinical and alarming to non-technical audiences
- **Neural network / GAN / diffusion model** -- too technical for marketing content; save for technical documentation
- **Generative AI** (as a standalone descriptor) -- too broad; always specify what we generate (infant imagery)
- **Artificial intelligence** (spelled out) -- "AI" is universally understood; the full term sounds dated
- **Machine learning** -- too technical for our audience; use "AI" as the umbrella term
- **Algorithm** -- vague and sometimes carries negative connotation (social media algorithm, etc.)

## Brand Terminology

These terms have specific meanings at babystudio. Use them consistently as defined here and in the Brand Guidelines glossary.

| Term | Definition | Usage Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **AI talent** | The AI-generated infants in our imagery | Primary external term. Positions output as equivalent to human talent. |
| **Synthetic talent** | Alternate term for AI-generated infants | More technical/compliance contexts. Appropriate for legal and governance discussions. |
| **Governed imagery** | Images produced with our compliance framework applied | Emphasizes the governance layer that differentiates us. |
| **Production infrastructure** | The full system -- tools, governance, expertise -- that produces assets | Use when describing what we provide holistically. |
| **Age-use alignment** | Governance check: depicted infant age matches appropriate product use | Key differentiator. Use in compliance and safety discussions. |
| **Safe positioning** | Governance check: infants depicted in safe, realistic interactions | Complements age-use alignment. |
| **Creative control** | Ability to specify expression, demographics, product interaction, positioning | Use when discussing advantage over traditional production unpredictability. |
| **Demographic flexibility** | Ability to generate imagery across any ethnicity, age range, or market | Not "diversity" alone -- it is about precision, not just variety. |
| **Compliance documentation** | Disclosure guidance, governance records, usage documentation with every asset | Emphasizes compliance as part of the deliverable. |
| **Traditional production** | Conventional baby photoshoots with live infant talent | Neutral reference to incumbent approach. Not pejorative. |
| **The 20-minute window** | Legal restriction on infant camera time | Powerful shorthand for the core production problem. |
| **The compliance tax** | ~5x cost markup from welfare workers, permits, nurses, backup babies | Use in cost advantage discussions. Memorable for enterprise buyers. |
| **babystudio** | Always lowercase, one word | Never "Baby Studio," "BabyStudio," or "Babystudio." |

## Common Writing Scenarios

### Introducing babystudio for the First Time

Lead with the problem, not the company. Establish the pain before presenting the solution. Use the 20-minute window or compliance tax as entry points -- they are concrete, memorable, and immediately recognizable to anyone in the category.

**Pattern:** Problem statement (1-2 sentences) --> babystudio introduction (1 sentence) --> Key differentiation (1-2 sentences) --> Proof point or next step (1 sentence).

### Describing Our Technology

Never lead with the technology. Lead with what it enables. Describe the outcome first, then explain how we achieve it only if the context requires it. Most audiences care about what they get, not how we build it.

**Pattern:** Outcome statement --> Supporting capability --> Governance layer --> Evidence.

### Addressing AI Skepticism

Acknowledge the concern as valid. Never dismiss skepticism about AI imagery. Reframe from "Will AI be good enough?" to "What standards does the imagery need to meet, and how do we verify it meets them?" Offer to demonstrate rather than argue.

**Pattern:** Acknowledge concern --> Reframe to standards --> Offer demonstration --> Show governance.

### Writing About Competitors

Never disparage competitors. State what we offer and let the comparison speak. When discussing traditional production, acknowledge the craft involved. When discussing stock, acknowledge the speed advantage. When discussing general AI, acknowledge their technical capability. Then explain what we do differently and why it matters for the baby category specifically.

**Pattern:** What they offer (honest) --> What we offer differently (specific) --> Why the difference matters for the reader.

## How to Use This Document

### For Writers

Before writing any babystudio content:
1. Identify your audience (Enterprise Emma, Startup Sam, or Agency Alex)
2. Identify the channel (website, email, social, sales, support)
3. Identify the funnel stage (awareness, consideration, decision, post-sale)
4. Review the relevant tone modifier sections
5. Write your first draft, then check against the base voice characteristics
6. Review the preferred words list and example rewrites for calibration
7. Read it aloud -- babystudio content should sound like a thoughtful professional speaking, not a marketing department writing

### For Reviewers

When reviewing content for voice and tone alignment:
1. Check the base voice characteristics: Is it clear? Direct? Measured? Human? Assertive? Trust-forward?
2. Check the tone modifiers: Does it match the appropriate audience, channel, and funnel stage?
3. Check the word list: Are we using preferred terms? Are we avoiding words on the avoid list?
4. Check jargon: Is technical language appropriate for the audience? Are babystudio-specific terms defined on first use?
5. Check structure: Are paragraphs short? Sentences varied? Active voice dominant?

### For Campaign Planning

When planning multi-touch campaigns:
1. Define the audience and funnel stage progression for the campaign
2. Map tone modifiers to each touch (awareness content sounds different from decision-stage content)
3. Ensure consistency in voice across all touches -- tone flexes, voice stays constant
4. Use example rewrites as calibration benchmarks for creative teams

### Update Cadence

- Review quarterly for continued alignment with brand direction
- Update example rewrites as new content patterns emerge
- Add new tone modifier contexts as new channels are activated
- Incorporate feedback from content review processes

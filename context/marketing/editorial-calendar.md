# Editorial Calendar

This document provides a 90-day rolling framework for planning, producing, and publishing babystudio content across all channels. It defines monthly themes, weekly cadences, content mix ratios, production workflows, and repurposing strategies. It is the operational bridge between strategy (what we write and why) and execution (what gets published and when).

**Companion documents:**
- Channel Strategy (`context/marketing/channel-strategy.md`) -- where we publish and how channels work together
- Content Pillars (`context/marketing/content-pillars.md`) -- topical framework for all content
- SEO Keyword Strategy (`context/marketing/seo-keyword-strategy.md`) -- organic search targeting
- Audience Segments (`context/marketing/audience-segments.md`) -- who we are writing for
- Messaging Framework (`context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`) -- what we say to each persona
- Tone of Voice (`context/marketing/tone-of-voice.md`) -- how we say it
- Brand Guidelines (`context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`) -- voice, terminology, visual direction

---

## Editorial Calendar Philosophy

Three principles govern how we plan and execute content:

1. **Consistency over volume.** Publishing 3 excellent pieces per week is better than publishing 7 mediocre ones. Every piece that carries the babystudio name should be the best thing written on its topic for our audience. Miss a publishing slot before lowering quality.

2. **Compounding over campaigns.** Short-term campaigns create spikes. A consistent editorial calendar creates compounding returns. Every post builds on the last. Every keyword targeted adds to the search portfolio. Every email deepens the relationship. The calendar is designed for sustained momentum, not bursts.

3. **Flexibility within structure.** The calendar provides a framework, not a rigid schedule. Market events, customer feedback, and performance data should inform what we publish each week. The structure ensures we cover all pillars and channels. The flexibility ensures we stay relevant and responsive.

## 90-Day Framework

### Month 1: Foundation

**Theme: The Production Problem**

The first month is about establishing babystudio's voice and building an audience by naming the pain that our buyers have normalized. We lead with Pillar 1 (The Production Problem) because every buying journey starts with problem recognition. We earn the right to talk about our solution by demonstrating that we understand the problem better than anyone.

**Monthly objectives:**
- Establish consistent publishing cadence across LinkedIn, blog, and email
- Build initial LinkedIn following and engagement baseline
- Publish 3 foundational blog posts that anchor our SEO strategy
- Launch email newsletter and begin cold outreach sequences
- Create a content library foundation for repurposing

## Content Mix Ratios

### By Content Pillar

These ratios guide the overall distribution of content across pillars. They apply to the total body of content across all channels.

| Pillar | Month 1-3 (Foundation) | Month 4-6 (Growth) | Month 7-12 (Scale) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Pillar 1: The Production Problem** | 35% | 25% | 15% |
| **Pillar 2: Governed AI Imagery** | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| **Pillar 3: Business Impact** | 15% | 25% | 30% |
| **Pillar 4: Industry Perspective** | 15% | 15% | 25% |
| **Pillar 5: Behind the Scenes** | 10% | 10% | 10% |

**Rationale for shift over time:**
- Early stage: Over-index on problem awareness because most prospects do not know the problem is solvable.
- Growth stage: Business impact evidence becomes critical as customer data accumulates.
- Scale stage: Thought leadership (Pillar 4) maintains category authority. Business impact (Pillar 3) continues to drive decisions.
- Behind the scenes (Pillar 5) stays steady -- trust through transparency is always relevant but never the primary focus.

### By Content Purpose

| Purpose | Ratio | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Educational** | 40% | Teaches something valuable. Pillars 1 and 2 content. Builds trust and expertise. |
| **Thought leadership** | 25% | Shares a perspective or analysis. Pillar 4 content. Builds authority and industry credibility. |
| **Social proof / results** | 20% | Proves value with data and customer evidence. Pillar 3 content. Drives conversion. |
| **Trust / transparency** | 10% | Humanizes the brand. Pillar 5 content. Builds relationship. |
| **Direct promotional** | 5% | Product announcements, offers, direct CTAs. Used sparingly. |

### By Persona

| Persona | % of Content Effort | Primary Pillars | Primary Channels |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Enterprise Emma** | 40% | Pillar 2, 3, 4 | LinkedIn thought leadership, email, blog, events |
| **Startup Sam** | 35% | Pillar 1, 3, 5 | LinkedIn tactical posts, email, blog, podcasts |
| **Agency Alex** | 25% | Pillar 1, 5, 3 | LinkedIn, events, trade media, email |

---

## Key Dates and Events Calendar

Content planning must account for industry events, seasonal moments, and business cycles that affect our audience's priorities and receptivity.

### Industry Events (Annual Cycle)

| Event | Typical Timing | Content Implication |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| ABC Kids Expo | September/October | Pre-event thought leadership, networking prep, post-event follow-up content |
| JPMA Baby Show | Spring (April/May) | Baby product industry content, product launch cycle alignment |
| CAGNY | February | CPG executive-focused content, budget season alignment |
| Shoptalk | March | E-commerce and retail content push |
| ANA Masters of Marketing | October | Senior marketer content, thought leadership |
| Advertising Week | October | Agency-focused content, creative production themes |
| CES | January | AI and technology trend content |
| Cannes Lions | June | Agency creativity content, industry perspective |

### Seasonal Content Moments

| Season | Timing | Content Opportunity |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Budget planning season** | September-November | ROI content, cost comparison tools, TCO analyses. Enterprise Emma is setting next year's budget. |
| **Q1 product launches** | January-March | Speed-to-market content. Brands are rushing to get Q1 imagery ready. Production bottleneck pain is acute. |
| **Spring product cycle** | March-May | New product imagery demand peaks. Traditional shoot scheduling conflicts increase. |
| **Back-to-school prep** | May-July | Baby product brands prepare inventory and marketing for fall. Imagery production timelines are compressed. |
| **Holiday prep** | July-September | Q4 holiday season imagery production begins. Compressed timelines create production pressure. |
| **Fall product cycle** | September-November | Second major product launch cycle. Localization needs increase for holiday global campaigns. |
| **Year-end planning** | November-December | Strategic content about trends, predictions, and planning for the new year. Budget utilization pressure. |

### Product Launch Windows

Baby product brands typically have two major launch cycles:
- **Spring (March-May):** New product lines for spring/summer. Imagery production should complete by February.
- **Fall (September-November):** Holiday and back-to-school product launches. Imagery production should complete by August.

**Content implication:** In the months preceding each launch cycle (January-February and July-August), increase production problem content (Pillar 1) and speed-to-market content (Pillar 3). These are the moments when production pain is most acute and prospects are most receptive.

## Repurposing Strategy

Every pillar content piece (blog posts, case studies, whitepapers) should generate multiple derivative pieces across channels. Repurposing is not lazy -- it is strategic. Different people consume content in different formats on different channels. The insight is the same. The packaging changes.

### Blog Post Repurposing Matrix

One blog post (2,000+ words) becomes:

| Derivative | Channel | Timing | How to Extract |
|------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| LinkedIn post #1 | LinkedIn | Day 0 (publish day) | Lead insight or most surprising data point. Standalone value. |
| LinkedIn post #2 | LinkedIn | Day 3-4 | Different angle or secondary insight from the post. |
| LinkedIn post #3 | LinkedIn | Day 7-10 | Follow-up point, reader response, or related observation. |
| LinkedIn post #4 (optional) | LinkedIn | Day 14+ | If post performs well, revisit with a new framing. |
| Newsletter feature | Email | Next newsletter edition | 150-200 word summary of the key insight with link to full post. |
| Nurture email addition | Email | Ongoing | Add to appropriate position in nurture sequence based on pillar and funnel stage. |
| Pull quotes (2-3) | Social / sales materials | Ongoing | Extract the most quotable sentences for graphics or sales decks. |
| Key data points | Sales materials | Ongoing | Extract specific numbers for use in sales conversations and ROI tools. |
| Conference talking point | Events | Ongoing | Add key insights to speaking preparation notes. |

### Case Study Repurposing Matrix

One case study becomes:

| Derivative | Channel | How to Extract |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| LinkedIn carousel | LinkedIn | Key metrics and before/after in visual format (5-8 slides) |
| LinkedIn text post | LinkedIn | The "headline stat" as a standalone insight |
| Email feature | Newsletter | Summary with the most compelling metric |
| Sales leave-behind | Sales | Formatted as a shareable PDF for post-meeting follow-up |
| Blog post expansion | Blog | Deeper analysis of the methodology or results |
| Quote graphic | Social | Customer quote or key result as a visual |
| Pitch deck slide | Sales | Before/after metrics as a single presentation slide |

### Podcast Appearance Repurposing Matrix

One podcast guest appearance becomes:

| Derivative | Channel | How to Extract |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Blog recap | Blog | "Key Takeaways from [Podcast Name]" with expanded points |
| LinkedIn post #1 | LinkedIn | Best quote or most interesting exchange |
| LinkedIn post #2 | LinkedIn | A question from the host that sparked an interesting answer |
| LinkedIn post #3 | LinkedIn | A point you wish you had made better, expanded |
| Newsletter feature | Email | Link to episode with a note about what to listen for |
| Audio clip (1-2 min) | Social | Most compelling segment, shared as native video or audio |
| Quote graphic | Social | A single quotable line from the episode |

---

## Buffer Content

Pre-produced content to fill gaps caused by holidays, unexpected schedule disruptions, or when a planned piece is delayed. Buffer content should be evergreen (not time-sensitive) and cover multiple pillars.

### Buffer Content Inventory (Maintain 2-3 Weeks of Buffer)

| Content Type | Pillar | Topic | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| LinkedIn post (x5) | Mixed | Evergreen production problem posts, governance insights, cost data | Rotate through pillars. Use when a planned post is delayed. |
| Blog post (x1) | Pillar 2 | "How babystudio Defines and Maintains Photorealistic Quality Standards" | Evergreen. Can publish any time without topical dependency. |
| Blog post (x1) | Pillar 1 | "The 30-40% Failure Rate No One Talks About in Baby Photography" | Evergreen. Strong awareness-stage content. |
| Email newsletter (x1) | Pillar 4 | Pre-written industry perspective edition | Evergreen observation about the category. |
| LinkedIn carousel (x1) | Pillar 3 | Cost comparison infographic | Evergreen data visualization. |

**Buffer maintenance:** At the end of each month, assess buffer inventory. If fewer than 2 weeks of buffer content remain, add buffer content production to the next month's plan.

---

**Review checklist:**
- 90-day content program performance: What worked? What did not?

- Channel performance: Should we adjust the primary/secondary channel mix?
- Pillar relevance: Do the five pillars still reflect our audience's concerns?

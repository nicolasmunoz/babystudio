# Email Marketing Playbook

## Overview

Email is babystudio's highest-converting owned channel. It turns awareness into conversations and conversations into pipeline. While LinkedIn creates visibility, email deepens relationships, delivers personalized value, and generates the direct engagement that moves prospects through the buying journey.

This playbook governs all email content produced by babystudio -- from cold outreach to nurture sequences to the bi-weekly newsletter. It defines structure, tone, timing, personalization, and measurement for every email type.

**Who uses this playbook:**
- **Email Marketing Specialist:** Primary reference for all email creation, sequencing, and optimization
- **Content Writer:** Reference for email-specific tone, structure, and CTA patterns
- **Content Strategist:** Alignment between email programs and broader content calendar

**Companion documents:**
- Brand Guidelines (`context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`) -- voice, terminology, writing standards
- Tone of Voice (`context/marketing/tone-of-voice.md`) -- email-specific tone modifiers
- Messaging Framework (`context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`) -- persona-specific messages and proof points

## Email Types

babystudio uses six distinct email types. Each serves a different purpose, targets a different moment in the buyer journey, and follows different structural rules. Never mix types within a single email.

### Type 1: Cold Outreach

**Purpose:** Generate meetings with qualified prospects who match babystudio's ideal customer profile. The goal is a reply, not a click. Every cold email should feel like it was written for one person, because it was.

**Tone:** Human, direct, measured. More conversational than website copy. Earn the right to be read by leading with relevance, not your company. Do not pitch. Open a door.

**Length:** 75-125 words. Every sentence must earn its place. If a sentence does not create curiosity, build credibility, or prompt action, remove it.

**Structure:** Hook --> Pain --> Value --> Soft CTA

1. **Hook (1 sentence):** Reference something specific about the recipient -- a product they market, a challenge their company faces, a piece of content they published, or a trigger event. Never open with your company name.
2. **Pain (1-2 sentences):** Name a specific pain point they recognize. Use concrete numbers or scenarios. The compliance tax, the 20-minute window, usage rights expiration, or localization friction.
3. **Value (1-2 sentences):** State what babystudio delivers -- briefly, specifically, with one proof point. Do not explain how. Just state the outcome.
4. **Soft CTA (1 sentence):** Ask a low-commitment question. "Would it be useful to see a sample set with your product?" or "Worth a 15-minute conversation?" Never use "Let me know if you're interested" -- it is passive and forgettable.

**Personalization requirements:**
- Every cold email must reference something specific about the recipient or their company
- Personalization goes beyond [First Name] -- it must demonstrate research
- Reference a specific product, campaign, market expansion, or public statement
- Adapt pain point framing to match their persona (Enterprise Emma: compliance tax; Startup Sam: cost gap; Agency Alex: production risk)

**What to avoid:**
- Opening with "I hope this email finds you well" or any variant
- Starting with "My name is..." or "I'm reaching out from babystudio..."
- Sending the same email to Enterprise Emma and Startup Sam
- Including more than one CTA
- Attaching files or including multiple links
- Using "just following up" as a subject line

---

### Type 2: Nurture Sequences

**Purpose:** Educate and build trust with leads who are aware of babystudio but not yet ready to buy. Nurture sequences deliver value consistently over time, building the knowledge and confidence a prospect needs to take the next step.

**Tone:** Educational, value-forward, warm but professional. More relational than cold outreach. Give before you ask. Each email should feel like a knowledgeable colleague sharing something useful, not a vendor pushing toward a sale.

**Length:** 150-250 words. Long enough to deliver genuine insight. Short enough to read in under two minutes.

**Structure:** Insight --> Evidence --> Connection --> CTA

1. **Insight (1-2 sentences):** Lead with a useful observation, data point, or framework. The reader should learn something valuable even if they never buy from babystudio.
2. **Evidence (2-4 sentences):** Support the insight with specific data, an example, or a concrete scenario. This is where credibility is built.
3. **Connection (1-2 sentences):** Bridge the insight to babystudio's value proposition. This should feel natural, not forced. "This is exactly why we built..." or "This is the problem governed AI imagery solves."
4. **CTA (1 sentence):** Soft and progressive. Early sequence emails: "Reply if this resonates." Middle sequence: "Here is a deeper dive [link]." Late sequence: "Would it be useful to see this with your product?"

**Personalization requirements:**
- Segment by persona (Enterprise Emma, Startup Sam, Agency Alex)
- Reference the entry point -- how did they enter the nurture? (downloaded a guide, attended a webinar, engaged on LinkedIn, replied to cold outreach)
- Adapt proof points and examples to their segment
- Use dynamic content blocks for persona-specific evidence

**Sequence structure (8-touch, 8 weeks):**

| Touch | Week | Content Focus | Pillar | CTA Level |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | Welcome + core problem framing | Pillar 1 | Low (reply) |
| 2 | 2 | The compliance tax deep dive | Pillar 1 | Low (read more) |
| 3 | 3 | How governed AI imagery works | Pillar 2 | Medium (link to explainer) |
| 4 | 4 | Cost comparison and ROI data | Pillar 3 | Medium (ROI calculator) |
| 5 | 5 | Governance framework and compliance docs | Pillar 2 | Medium (sample docs) |
| 6 | 6 | Industry perspective -- category direction | Pillar 4 | Low (share perspective) |
| 7 | 7 | Behind the scenes -- how we built this | Pillar 5 | Low (reply with questions) |
| 8 | 8 | Invitation to next step | Pillar 3 | High (demo/sample/call) |

After sequence completion, transition to newsletter.

---

### Type 3: Newsletter

**Purpose:** Ongoing relationship maintenance, thought leadership, and top-of-mind positioning. The newsletter is babystudio's recurring touchpoint with every contact in the database -- prospects, partners, and eventually customers.

**Tone:** The most human and opinionated of all email formats. The newsletter reads like a knowledgeable colleague sharing what they are seeing in the baby product marketing category. It is not a promotional digest. It is not a product update feed. It is a point of view worth subscribing to.

**Length:** 300-500 words total. Bi-weekly (every other Thursday).

**Structure:** Intro --> 2-3 Sections --> CTA

1. **Intro (2-3 sentences):** Open with a timely observation, a surprising data point, or a direct statement about something happening in the industry. Set the theme for the edition. Never open with "Welcome to this edition of..."
2. **Section 1 -- Featured Insight (150-200 words):** Original thought leadership. A point of view on a trend, a problem, or a development in baby product marketing, AI imagery, or compliance. This is the section that earns the open next time.
3. **Section 2 -- Content Spotlight (50-75 words):** Link to a recent blog post, case study, or resource. Brief context on why it matters. Not a summary -- a reason to click.
4. **Section 3 -- Industry Signal (50-75 words):** A data point, a regulatory update, a competitor move, or a market observation. Something the reader would not have seen elsewhere.
5. **CTA (1-2 sentences):** Always low-pressure. "Reply to this email with your take." "See your product in babystudio imagery." "Read the full analysis." Never "Schedule a demo now."

**Personalization requirements:**
- Segment by persona for dynamic content blocks where relevant
- Personalize the greeting (first name)
- Vary the featured insight topic to cover all personas over time
- Track which content links each subscriber clicks to inform future personalization

---

### Type 4: Follow-Up / Post-Demo

**Purpose:** Maintain momentum after a meaningful interaction -- a demo, a sales conversation, a conference meeting, or a sample review. The follow-up bridges the gap between interest and action.

**Tone:** Warm, specific, action-oriented. Reference the conversation directly. Show that you listened. Make the next step clear and easy.

**Length:** 100-150 words. Brevity signals respect for their time and confidence in the value of the interaction.

**Structure:** Reference --> Recap --> Next Step

1. **Reference (1 sentence):** Acknowledge the specific interaction. "Thank you for the time today" is fine, but add specificity: "Thank you for walking me through your APAC localization challenges today."
2. **Recap (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the key takeaways or commitments from the conversation. This demonstrates listening and creates accountability. "You mentioned that usage rights renegotiation is consuming $40K annually. We discussed producing a sample set with your infant carrier to evaluate quality and governance documentation."
3. **Next Step (1-2 sentences):** State the agreed-upon next action with a specific timeline. "I will send the sample set by Thursday. Would the following week work for a review with your brand team?"

**Personalization requirements:**
- 100% personalized -- every follow-up is unique to the conversation
- Reference specific products, challenges, or stakeholders discussed
- Include any promised materials (compliance documentation samples, ROI projections, sample imagery)
- Mirror the language and framing the prospect used

---

### Type 5: Re-engagement

**Purpose:** Reconnect with prospects who have gone silent -- stopped opening emails, did not respond to follow-ups, or dropped out of a nurture sequence. The goal is to re-establish relevance or gracefully close the loop.

**Tone:** Brief, respectful, low-pressure. Acknowledge the silence without guilt. Offer a new reason to engage. Make it easy to say yes or no.

**Length:** 50-100 words. The shortest email type. Brevity is the re-engagement strategy.

**Structure:** Acknowledgment --> New Value --> Easy CTA

1. **Acknowledgment (1 sentence):** Name the silence without being passive-aggressive. "It has been a while since we connected" or "I know your inbox is demanding." Never say "I noticed you haven't opened my last 4 emails."
2. **New Value (1-2 sentences):** Offer something genuinely new -- a recent development, a new capability, a relevant industry change, or a fresh proof point. Do not repeat the last thing you sent.
3. **Easy CTA (1 sentence):** Make the response effort as low as possible. "Would a 2-minute overview be worth your time?" or "Reply YES if this is still relevant, or NO and I will stop reaching out." Give them an explicit off-ramp.

**Personalization requirements:**
- Reference their original interest or entry point
- Offer value relevant to their persona and last known funnel stage
- Adjust tone based on how long they have been inactive (2 weeks vs. 3 months)

---

### Type 6: Event-Triggered

**Purpose:** Respond to a specific prospect action or external event with timely, relevant outreach. These emails capitalize on moments of heightened relevance -- a website visit, a content download, a job posting, a competitor announcement, or a regulatory change.

**Tone:** Timely, relevant, helpful. The value is in the timing. Demonstrate awareness of their situation without being invasive. "I noticed" language should feel observant, not surveilling.

**Length:** Variable -- 75-200 words depending on the trigger. Match the weight of the trigger to the depth of the email.

**Structure:** Trigger Reference --> Relevance --> Offer

1. **Trigger Reference (1 sentence):** Name the event or action that prompted the email. Be specific. "I saw that [Company] is expanding into the Japanese market" or "Your team just posted a Product Marketing Manager role focused on Amazon."
2. **Relevance (1-3 sentences):** Connect the trigger to a babystudio value proposition. Explain why the trigger makes this conversation timely. Do not force the connection -- if it is not natural, do not send the email.
3. **Offer (1 sentence):** Propose a specific, helpful next step tied to the trigger. "We just helped a similar brand produce localized imagery for APAC. Happy to share what we learned."

**Trigger types and response timing:**

| Trigger | Response Window | Email Focus |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Website visit (pricing page) | Within 24 hours | Offer a cost comparison or sample set |
| Content download (compliance guide) | Within 24 hours | Offer deeper compliance conversation |
| Job posting (content/imagery role) | Within 48 hours | Reference the capability gap they are filling |
| Competitor announcement (AI imagery) | Within 48 hours | Provide differentiation perspective |
| Regulatory change (AI disclosure) | Within 1 week | Share compliance analysis |
| Product launch announcement | Within 1 week | Reference imagery needs for new product |
| Geographic expansion news | Within 1 week | Localization value proposition |
| Usage rights expiration (if known) | 60 days before | Perpetual rights alternative |

## Subject Line Formulas

Subject lines determine whether the email is opened. For babystudio, subject lines must create curiosity through relevance, not hype. They should feel like something a knowledgeable colleague would write, not a marketing department.

### General Rules

- Length: 4-8 words. Under 50 characters. Mobile preview shows 30-40 characters.
- No exclamation points. Ever.
- No ALL CAPS words.
- No clickbait. The email must deliver on the subject line's promise.
- Lowercase is acceptable for a more personal feel in cold outreach.
- Personalization tokens ([First Name], [Company]) are acceptable but not required.
- Preview text (preheader) is the second subject line. Use it to extend curiosity, not repeat the subject.

### By Email Type

**Cold Outreach Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Pain-based | "the compliance tax on [Company]'s imagery" |
| Question-based | "how does [Company] handle baby imagery rights?" |
| Stat-based | "$2,500 per baby image -- is that right?" |
| Curiosity | "the 20-minute window" |
| Peer reference | "what [Similar Brand] changed about their shoots" |
| Direct | "baby imagery production at [Company]" |

**Nurture Sequence Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Insight-based | "where the $2,500 actually goes" |
| Continuation | "the rights problem we mentioned last week" |
| Question | "what happens when usage rights expire?" |
| Data-driven | "50-70% -- the cost gap most brands miss" |
| Framework | "the three governance checks your legal team wants" |
| Contrarian | "why 'authentic' baby photos aren't what you think" |

**Newsletter Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Observation | "a major brand just pulled their holiday campaign" |
| Trend | "three things changing in baby product imagery" |
| Data point | "the number that explains baby content costs" |
| Question | "is your baby imagery expiring this quarter?" |
| Direct statement | "AI disclosure rules just changed on Amazon" |
| Curated | "what we're reading about AI in CPG marketing" |

**Follow-Up Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Reference | "re: your APAC imagery question" |
| Deliverable | "the sample set we discussed" |
| Next step | "compliance docs for your legal team" |
| Check-in | "following up from Thursday's conversation" |

**Re-engagement Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct | "still relevant?" |
| New value | "something changed since we last talked" |
| Low-pressure | "quick question about [Company]'s imagery" |
| Permission-based | "should I stop reaching out?" |

**Event-Triggered Subject Lines:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Trigger-specific | "saw [Company]'s Japan expansion news" |
| Helpful | "imagery for your new product launch" |
| Timely | "the new Amazon AI disclosure policy" |
| Connection | "your new PMM role -- we can help" |

## Email Structure Templates

### Cold Outreach Template

```
Subject: [pain-based or question-based formula]
Preview: [extends the subject with a specific detail]

Hi [First Name],

[Hook: 1 sentence referencing something specific about them]

[Pain: 1-2 sentences naming a concrete challenge with a number or scenario]

[Value: 1-2 sentences stating what babystudio delivers -- outcome, not features]

[Soft CTA: 1 question, low commitment]

[First Name]
[Signature]
```

**Opening line patterns for cold outreach:**
- "Your [Product] listing on Amazon uses product-only images. That is leaving conversion on the table."
- "[Company] expanded into three new markets last quarter. That means three sets of localized imagery."
- "I read your LinkedIn post about production costs. The numbers you shared are consistent with what we see across the category."
- "Your team just hired a Content Production Manager. The timing is interesting."

**PS line strategy:** Use sparingly (1 in 5 emails). The PS line catches scanners. Best used for a proof point that did not fit the body. "PS: [Similar Brand] reduced their per-image cost from $2,800 to $900 using this approach."

## Personalization Framework

### By Persona

| Element | Enterprise Emma | Startup Sam | Agency Alex |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pain point lead** | Compliance tax, localization friction, legal review burden | Cost gap, competitive imagery parity, production bottleneck | Production unpredictability, margin erosion, client frustration |
| **Proof point type** | Quantified ROI, compliance documentation, enterprise reference | Cost per image, speed to market, competitive comparison | Partnership model, client value, production reliability |

### By Funnel Stage

| Stage | Email Focus | Proof Points | CTA Intensity |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | Name the problem. Quantify the pain. Do not mention babystudio in the first email. | Industry data, cost benchmarks, pain scenarios | Very low: "Does this resonate?" |
| **Consideration** | Educate on the solution category. Position governed AI imagery. | How it works, quality evidence, governance framework | Low-medium: "Here is a deeper dive" |
| **Decision** | Provide evidence for the specific decision. Address remaining objections. | ROI projections, compliance docs, sample imagery | Medium-high: "Let us produce a sample set" |
| **Post-Demo** | Maintain momentum. Deliver on promises. Advance to next step. | Conversation-specific evidence, tailored materials | High: "Here is the pilot proposal" |

### By Trigger Event

| Trigger | Personalization Approach |

### Dynamic Content Blocks

For emails sent to mixed audiences, use dynamic content blocks to swap persona-specific elements:

- **Pain point paragraph:** Swap based on persona tag
- **Proof point:** Swap enterprise references for DTC examples (or agency examples)
- **CTA:** Swap based on funnel stage
- **PS line:** Swap based on persona and trigger
- **Case reference:** Swap based on industry/segment match

---

## Sequence Timing Guidelines

### Cold Outreach Sequence (5 touches, 18 days)

| Touch | Day | Content Focus | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------------|-------|
| Email 1 | Day 0 | Lead with pain point | Most personalized email in the sequence |
| Email 2 | Day 3 | Share insight or data point | No pitch. Value only. |
| Email 3 | Day 7 | Case example or proof point | Ask a question |
| Email 4 | Day 12 | Governance/compliance angle | Differentiation |
| Email 5 | Day 18 | Direct ask with sample offer | Last touch. Clear CTA. |

**Rules:**
- If the prospect replies at any point, stop the sequence and respond personally
- If the prospect opens Email 1 but does not reply, send Email 2 on schedule
- If the prospect does not open any of the first 3 emails, adjust subject line approach for Emails 4-5
- Never send more than 5 cold emails to the same prospect without a reply
- Wait 60 days before re-engaging a prospect who completed the sequence without replying

### Nurture Sequence (8 touches, 8 weeks)

| Touch | Week | Spacing | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| Email 1 | 1 | -- | Welcome, within 24 hours of entry |
| Email 2 | 2 | 7 days | Compliance tax deep dive |
| Email 3 | 3 | 7 days | Solution education |
| Email 4 | 4 | 7 days | ROI and cost data |
| Email 5 | 5 | 7 days | Governance framework |
| Email 6 | 6 | 7 days | Industry perspective |
| Email 7 | 7 | 7 days | Behind the scenes |
| Email 8 | 8 | 7 days | Next step invitation |

After sequence completion: transition to bi-weekly newsletter.

### Newsletter (Ongoing)

- **Frequency:** Every other Thursday
- **Consistency is non-negotiable.** Do not skip editions. If content is thin, shorten the edition rather than skipping it.

### Best Send Times by Persona

| Persona | Best Days | Best Times (ET) | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Enterprise Emma | Tuesday-Thursday | 7:30-9:00 AM | She processes email early before meetings fill the day |
| Startup Sam | Tuesday-Wednesday | 10:00-11:30 AM | She is in execution mode early; reads email mid-morning |
| Agency Alex | Tuesday-Thursday | 8:00-9:30 AM | He checks email before creative reviews begin |

### Day-of-Week Preferences

| Day | Suitability | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| Monday | Low | Inbox overload from weekend. Emails get buried. |
| Tuesday | High | Best day for cold outreach and nurture. |
| Wednesday | High | Strong for newsletters and educational content. |
| Thursday | High | Good for follow-ups and newsletters. |
| Friday | Low-Medium | Acceptable for re-engagement (lighter inbox). Avoid cold outreach. |
| Saturday-Sunday | Avoid | Do not send B2B email on weekends. |

---

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test

| Element | Test Approach | Impact Level |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Subject lines** | Test two subject line formulas per sequence | Highest -- determines open rate |
| **Opening lines** | Test pain-based vs. insight-based hooks | High -- determines read-through |
| **CTA phrasing** | Test question CTA vs. statement CTA | High -- determines reply rate |
| **Email length** | Test 75-word vs. 125-word cold outreach | Medium -- affects engagement |
| **Send time** | Test morning vs. midday by persona | Medium -- affects open rate |
| **Personalization depth** | Test light (name + company) vs. deep (product + trigger) | Medium -- affects reply rate |
| **PS line** | Test with PS vs. without PS | Low-Medium -- affects conversion |
| **Sender name** | Test founder name vs. team member name | Low-Medium -- affects open rate |

### Testing Rules

- **Test one variable at a time.** Changing subject line and CTA simultaneously produces unusable data.
- **Minimum sample size:** 50 recipients per variant for cold outreach. 200 per variant for newsletter.
- **Statistical significance:** Wait for 95% confidence before declaring a winner. Use a significance calculator.
- **Testing cadence:** Run one test per email type per month. Document every test and result.
- **Implementing winners:** Once a winner is confirmed, update the relevant template. Document why it won.

### Test Documentation Template

| Test ID | Date | Email Type | Variable | Variant A | Variant B | Sample Size | Winner | Margin | Learning |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| T001 | -- | Cold outreach | Subject | Pain-based | Question-based | 100 | -- | -- | -- |

---

## Compliance

### CAN-SPAM Requirements

- **Sender identification:** Every email includes babystudio's physical address and sender identity
- **Opt-out mechanism:** Every email includes a clear, functional unsubscribe link
- **Opt-out processing:** Unsubscribe requests processed within 10 business days (target: 24 hours)
- **Subject line honesty:** Subject lines accurately reflect the content of the email
- **No deceptive headers:** "From," "To," and "Reply-To" fields accurately identify the sender

### AI Disclosure

- babystudio is an AI imagery company. Our emails may reference AI-generated imagery.
- If an email includes sample AI-generated imagery, include a brief note: "Images shown are AI-generated by babystudio with full governance documentation."
- Do not misrepresent AI-generated images as traditional photography in email content.
- Follow platform-specific disclosure guidance when linking to landing pages with AI imagery.

### Data Handling

- **Prospect data:** Collected from public sources (LinkedIn, company websites, industry directories) or opt-in forms
- **Consent:** Cold outreach relies on legitimate business interest. Nurture and newsletter require explicit opt-in.
- **Data storage:** Prospect data stored in CRM with access controls
- **Data retention:** Inactive contacts (no opens for 6 months) are moved to a suppression list, not deleted
- **Do not email:** Maintain a suppression list of contacts who have opted out, bounced hard, or requested removal

### Anti-Spam Best Practices

- Send from a verified domain with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configured
- Warm new sending domains gradually (start with 10-20 emails/day, increase over 2 weeks)
- Monitor sender reputation weekly
- Keep bounce rate below 2%
- Keep spam complaint rate below 0.1%
- Do not use purchased email lists

---

## Tone Adaptation for Email

The babystudio brand voice (clear, direct, measured, human, assertive, trust-forward) adapts for email as follows. These adaptations apply across all email types, with type-specific adjustments noted in each type's section above.

### General Email Tone Shifts

**More conversational.** Email is a one-to-one medium. Write as though you are speaking to one person, because you are. Use "you" and "your" freely. Use "I" (not "we") in cold outreach from a named sender. Use "we" in newsletters and nurture sequences.

**Shorter sentences.** Average 12-15 words per sentence in email, compared to 15-20 for blog and website. Cut subordinate clauses. Front-load the important information.

**More personal pronouns.** Address the reader directly. "Your baby imagery production" not "Baby imagery production." "You are spending" not "Brands are spending."

**Less formal transitions.** Replace "Furthermore" with a line break. Replace "In addition" with a new paragraph. Replace "It is important to note" with nothing -- just say the thing.

**Warmer closings.** "Best" or "Talk soon" for established relationships. "Looking forward to hearing your perspective" for cold outreach. Never "Regards" (too stiff) or "Cheers" (too casual for enterprise).

### What Does Not Change

- **Precision.** We still use specific numbers, not vague claims.
- **No superlatives.** We do not say "best" or "most" in email any more than we do elsewhere.
- **Trust-forward.** We still lead with governance and compliance when relevant.
- **No hype language.** No "exciting," no "amazing," no "game-changing." These words are banned in all channels including email.
- **Terminology consistency.** We still use "AI talent," "governed imagery," "compliance tax," and "the 20-minute window" as defined in brand guidelines.

## Self-Review Checklist

Before sending any babystudio email, confirm:

1. **Subject line is under 50 characters** and creates curiosity through relevance, not hype
2. **Preview text extends the subject line** rather than repeating it
3. **Opening line does not start with babystudio** or "I hope this email finds you well"
4. **The email delivers value** the recipient can use even if they never respond
5. **CTA is singular and clear** -- one ask per email, matched to funnel stage
6. **Personalization is genuine** -- references something specific about the recipient, not just [First Name]
7. **Tone matches the email type** -- conversational for cold, educational for nurture, opinionated for newsletter
8. **No banned words or phrases** -- no "exciting," "revolutionary," "game-changing," "best-in-class," or exclamation points
9. **Compliance elements present** -- unsubscribe link (nurture/newsletter), physical address, accurate sender info
10. **Read aloud test passed** -- the email sounds like a thoughtful professional, not a marketing template

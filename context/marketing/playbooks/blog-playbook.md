# Blog Playbook

## Overview

The blog is babystudio's content engine. Every other channel draws from it. LinkedIn posts are distilled from blog insights. Email sequences link to blog posts. Sales conversations reference blog evidence. Industry publication pitches are grounded in blog-level depth. And organic search brings in prospects who are actively looking for answers to the problems babystudio solves.

The blog serves three strategic functions:
1. **SEO foundation.** Every post targets a keyword cluster from the SEO Keyword Strategy, building compounding organic traffic over time.
2. **Thought leadership depth.** Blog content demonstrates the expertise that short-form channels can only hint at. This is where babystudio proves it understands the baby product imagery category better than anyone.
3. **Conversion hub.** Every post includes a call to action that moves the reader toward a meaningful next step -- newsletter signup, content download, sample request, or demo.

**Who uses this playbook:**
- **Content Writer:** Primary reference for all blog post creation -- structure, tone, SEO, CTAs
- **Content Strategist:** Planning tool for editorial calendar, keyword targeting, and cross-channel integration
- **Email Marketing Specialist:** Source material identification for email programs

## Blog Post Types

babystudio publishes seven types of blog posts. Each serves a different purpose in the buyer journey, targets different keywords, and follows different structural rules.

### Type 1: How-To / Educational

**Purpose:** Teach the reader something useful about baby product imagery, production, compliance, or e-commerce optimization. Position babystudio as the most helpful resource in the category. These posts earn organic traffic by answering questions prospects are already asking.

**Length:** 1,500-2,500 words.

**Structure:**
- H1: How to [achieve outcome] -- [qualifier or context]

---

### Type 2: Thought Leadership

**Purpose:** Share a point of view that challenges conventional thinking, introduces a new framework, or reframes a familiar problem. Thought leadership posts position babystudio's leadership as category experts worth listening to -- not because they sell a product, but because they see the market clearly.

**Length:** 1,200-2,000 words.

**Structure:**
- H1: [Clear, assertive position statement]

---

### Type 4: Case Study (Blog Format)

**Purpose:** Tell the story of a specific customer result -- the challenge, the approach, and the measurable outcome. Blog-format case studies are more narrative and accessible than formal PDF case studies. They are optimized for search and shareability.

**Length:** 800-1,200 words.

**Structure:**
- H1: How [Company/Segment] [Achieved Specific Outcome] with Governed AI Imagery

  - CTA: "See what this looks like with your product"

**SEO priority:** Medium. Case studies target commercial-intent keywords. They rank for brand + category queries and serve as conversion content.

**Example titles:**
- "How a DTC Baby Brand Produced 40 Product Images in 5 Days for Their Amazon Launch"
- "Reducing Baby Imagery Production Costs by 60%: A Fortune 500 Brand Case Study"

**Best for personas:** All three. Case studies are the strongest decision-stage content. Enterprise Emma wants enterprise examples. Startup Sam wants DTC examples. Agency Alex wants partnership examples.

---

### Type 5: Comparison / Versus Posts

**Purpose:** Provide an honest, evidence-based comparison between babystudio and alternatives -- traditional photography, stock imagery, or general AI platforms. These posts meet prospects at the moment they are evaluating options.

**Length:** 1,500-2,000 words.

**Structure:**
- H1: [Option A] vs. [Option B]: [What Audience Needs to Know]
- Intro: Why this comparison matters. The framework for evaluation. (100-150 words)

- H2: When [Option B] Is the Better Choice (100-150 words)
- H2: Conclusion -- How to Decide (100-150 words + CTA)

**SEO priority:** Very high. Comparison posts target high-intent commercial keywords. Searchers comparing options are close to a decision.

**Example titles:**
- "AI Talent vs. Live Talent: An Honest Comparison for Baby Product Brands"
- "$500 vs. $2,500: The Real Cost Comparison for Baby Product Imagery"
- "babystudio vs. Stock Photography: What Baby Brands Need to Know"
- "General AI Platforms vs. Baby-Specific AI Imagery: Why Specialization Matters"
- "Traditional Baby Photoshoots vs. AI Production: A Decision Framework"

**Best for personas:** All three. Comparison content serves mid-to-late funnel evaluation. Enterprise Emma needs nuanced analysis. Startup Sam needs clear cost comparison. Agency Alex needs capability comparison.

**Tone note:** These posts must be scrupulously fair. Acknowledge where alternatives have genuine strengths. Do not dismiss traditional photography or stock as inferior across the board. Earn trust through honesty, not spin.

---

### Type 6: Behind the Scenes

**Purpose:** Build trust through transparency. Show how babystudio works -- the process, the people, the governance methodology, the quality standards. These posts humanize an AI company and demonstrate that real expertise drives every image.

**Length:** 800-1,500 words.

**Structure:**
- H1: [Inside / Behind the Scenes] [Specific Process or Decision]

  - Explain what it means for quality, governance, or trust
- H2: What This Means for [You / Brands / the Industry] (100-200 words)
  - Takeaway for the reader
  - CTA: soft, trust-forward

**SEO priority:** Low-Medium. Behind-the-scenes content earns social shares and builds trust but does not typically target high-volume keywords. It contributes to overall domain quality.

**Example titles:**
- "From Brief to Image: How babystudio Produces Governed Infant Imagery"
- "The Three Governance Checks Every babystudio Image Must Pass"
- "Not Just AI: The Human Expertise Behind Every babystudio Image"
- "What Happens When an Image Fails a Governance Check"
- "How We Built a Compliance Framework for a Category That Did Not Have One"

**Best for personas:** Agency Alex (he evaluates production capabilities professionally) and Startup Sam (she connects with process transparency). Enterprise Emma engages moderately.

---

### Type 7: Guest / Contributed Posts

**Purpose:** Feature perspectives from industry experts, customers, or partners. Guest posts bring outside credibility to the blog, introduce new audiences, and signal that babystudio operates within a broader professional community.

**Length:** 800-1,200 words.

**Example titles:**

- "What I Learned Managing Baby Product Imagery for 15 Years -- by [Industry Veteran]"
- "The Agency Perspective: How AI Production Is Changing Client Conversations -- by [Agency Leader]"

## Structure Templates

### H1/H2/H3 Hierarchy Rules

Every blog post follows a clean heading hierarchy:

- **H1:** One per post. Contains the primary keyword. Matches or closely mirrors the title tag.
- **H2:** Major sections. 4-7 per post. Each addresses a distinct sub-topic. Include secondary keywords where natural. Every H2 should be understandable in isolation -- a reader scanning headings should grasp the article's structure.
- **H3:** Sub-sections within H2 blocks. 0-3 per H2 section. Use for breakdowns, examples, or supporting points.
- **H4:** Rare. Only for detailed sub-sub-sections in very long pillar content.
- **Never skip levels.** No H1 to H3 without an H2 between them.

### Intro Pattern (All Post Types)

Every blog post intro follows this pattern (100-150 words):

1. **Hook (1-2 sentences):** Capture attention with a surprising fact, a pain point, a question, or a direct statement. See Opening Hook Formulas below.
2. **Context (1-2 sentences):** Why this topic matters right now. What is at stake.
3. **Promise (1 sentence):** What the reader will learn or gain by reading. Be specific.
4. **Audience (optional, 1 sentence):** Who this is for, if it helps set expectations.

### Conclusion Pattern (All Post Types)

Every blog post conclusion follows this pattern (100-150 words):

1. **Summary (1-2 sentences):** Restate the core insight or takeaway. Do not introduce new information.
2. **Implication (1-2 sentences):** What should change based on what the reader learned.
3. **CTA (1-2 sentences):** A specific next step matched to the post type and funnel stage. See CTA Strategy below.

## SEO Integration

Every blog post is SEO-optimized following these standards. For comprehensive guidance, reference the SEO Keyword Strategy (`context/marketing/seo-keyword-strategy.md`).

### Title Tags

- **Format:** Primary Keyword: Descriptive Subtitle | babystudio
- **Length:** 50-60 characters including brand
- **Keyword placement:** Primary keyword within the first 40 characters
- **Brand tag:** Always include "| babystudio" at the end
- **Examples:**
  - "Baby Product Photography Cost: Complete Breakdown | babystudio"
  - "AI vs. Traditional Baby Imagery: Honest Comparison | babystudio"

### Meta Descriptions

- **Length:** 140-155 characters
- **Structure:** Value statement + specific detail + call to action
- **Include:** Primary keyword naturally, a specific number or data point
- **CTA language:** "Learn how," "See the comparison," "Get the guide"
- **Example:** "Traditional baby shoots cost $2,500+ per image after compliance. Learn what drives the cost and how governed AI imagery reduces it by 50-70%."

### Heading Structure

- H1 contains primary keyword
- At least one H2 contains a secondary keyword naturally
- H2s are scannable and meaningful in isolation
- Headings create a logical outline of the article

### Keyword Usage

- Primary keyword in: H1, first paragraph, at least one H2, conclusion
- 2-4 secondary keywords distributed naturally through the body
- No keyword stuffing. Write naturally. If it sounds forced, remove it.
- Include semantic keywords (related terms a thorough article would contain)
- Never use keyword phrases that violate brand guidelines (no "fake baby photos" regardless of search volume)

### Image Optimization

- **Alt text:** Descriptive, accurate. Include primary keyword only if it naturally describes the image.
  - Good: "Cost comparison chart showing traditional baby photography at $2,500 versus AI-generated imagery at $500-$1,500"
  - Bad: "baby product photography cost AI photography cost comparison babystudio"
- **File names:** Descriptive, hyphen-separated. "baby-product-photography-cost-comparison.jpg"
- **File size:** Under 200KB where possible. WebP format preferred.
- **Featured images:** Every post has a featured image. It should be relevant to the topic, high quality, and correctly sized for social sharing (1200x630px for Open Graph).

### Internal Linking

- **Minimum 3 internal links per post**
- Link to the cluster pillar page for the keyword cluster
- Link to at least 2 other posts within the same cluster or related clusters
- Use descriptive, keyword-relevant anchor text. Not "click here."
- Place links within body text where contextually relevant
- At least one link in the first half and one in the second half
- When publishing a new post, update 2-3 existing posts to link to it

### URL Structure

- **Format:** babystudio.com/blog/primary-keyword-phrase
- **Length:** 3-5 words after /blog/
- **No dates, numbers (unless part of keyword), or stop words**
- **Examples:**
  - babystudio.com/blog/baby-product-photography-cost
  - babystudio.com/blog/ai-vs-live-talent-comparison
  - babystudio.com/blog/amazon-ai-image-policy

## Tone Adaptation for Blog

The babystudio voice (clear, direct, measured, human, assertive, trust-forward) adapts for long-form blog content as follows.

### How Voice Shifts for Long-Form

**More exploratory.** Blog posts have space to develop ideas fully. Use that space to build arguments, present multiple perspectives, and earn conclusions through evidence rather than assertion.

**More evidence-heavy.** Every claim should be supported. Use specific data points, examples, comparisons, and references. The blog is where babystudio demonstrates rigor.

**Structured signposting.** Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold text to guide the reader through longer content. Every 200-300 words should have a subheading. Assume the reader will scan before reading.

**More nuanced.** Blog content acknowledges complexity. Traditional production has strengths. AI imagery has limitations. Both can be true simultaneously. Nuance builds trust with sophisticated readers (Enterprise Emma, Agency Alex).

### What Stays the Same

- **Clear language.** No jargon without explanation. No dense academic prose.
- **Direct structure.** Lead with the insight, support with evidence. Do not bury the lead.
- **Measured claims.** Use specific numbers, not superlatives. "50-70% cost reduction" not "dramatic savings."
- **Human tone.** Address the reader. Use "you" and "your." Acknowledge their challenges.
- **Trust-forward.** Lead with governance when discussing babystudio's approach.
- **Terminology consistency.** Use "AI talent," "governed imagery," "the compliance tax," "the 20-minute window" as defined in brand guidelines.

---

## Opening Hook Formulas

The opening line determines whether the reader stays. These formulas are designed for babystudio's topics and audience.

### Formula 1: The Stat Hook
**Pattern:** Lead with a specific, surprising number.
**Example:** "The average baby product photoshoot costs $2,500 per usable image after compliance overhead. For most brands, the photography itself accounts for less than 20% of that cost."

### Formula 2: The Story Hook
**Pattern:** Open with a specific moment or conversation.
**Example:** "A brand director told me last month that she cancelled her third baby shoot in a row. First baby had a cold. Second screamed through the 20-minute window. Third time, the parents no-showed."

### Formula 3: The Question Hook
**Pattern:** Ask a question the reader recognizes but has not fully considered.
**Example:** "What percentage of your baby product imagery budget actually goes to photography? If you have never itemized it, the answer will surprise you."

### Formula 4: The Contrarian Hook
**Pattern:** Challenge a widely held assumption.
**Example:** "Real babies do not make baby product imagery more authentic. They make it more unpredictable, more expensive, and more legally complex. Authenticity comes from accuracy, not production method."

### Formula 5: The Pain Point Hook
**Pattern:** Name a pain the reader has experienced.
**Example:** "If you have ever watched a product launch slip because a baby would not stop crying during the shoot, you understand the production problem that no one in baby marketing talks about publicly."

### Formula 6: The Quote Hook
**Pattern:** Open with a quote from a customer, industry figure, or notable source.
**Example:** "'We budget for failure.' That is how a VP Marketing at one of the five largest baby brands described their approach to infant imagery production."

### Formula 7: The Scenario Hook
**Pattern:** Paint a specific, recognizable scenario.
**Example:** "It is 6:30 AM. You are on set with a welfare worker, a nurse, three backup babies, and a photographer charging $800 per hour. The primary baby is asleep. Your launch window is 10 days away."

### Formula 8: The Comparison Hook
**Pattern:** Set up a striking comparison.
**Example:** "A standard CPG product photograph costs $200-500 per image. A baby product photograph costs $2,500 or more. The difference is not the camera, the studio, or the photographer. It is the compliance tax."

### Formula 9: The Trend Hook
**Pattern:** Reference a development that changes the landscape.
**Example:** "Amazon updated its AI-generated content policy last quarter. For baby product brands, the implications go beyond disclosure labels."

### Formula 10: The Direct Statement Hook
**Pattern:** Make a clear, assertive claim.
**Example:** "Baby product imagery is the most expensive, most unpredictable, and most compliance-burdened content production in consumer marketing. That does not have to be true."

## CTA Strategy

Every blog post includes a call to action. The CTA is matched to the post type and the most likely funnel stage of the reader.

### By Post Type and Funnel Stage

| Post Type | Likely Funnel Stage | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| How-To / Educational | Awareness | Newsletter signup | Related blog post |
| Thought Leadership | Awareness | Newsletter signup | LinkedIn follow |
| Industry Analysis | Awareness-Consideration | Content download (guide, report) | Newsletter signup |
| Case Study | Consideration-Decision | Sample set request | Demo booking |
| Comparison / Versus | Consideration-Decision | Sample set request | Cost calculator |
| Behind the Scenes | Awareness-Consideration | Newsletter signup | Demo booking |
| Guest / Contributed | Awareness | Newsletter signup | Related blog post |

### CTA Formats

**In-line CTA (within body text):** Natural mention of a next step within a relevant paragraph. "We produce a sample set with your actual product -- no commitment, no cost for the initial evaluation."

**End-of-post CTA (conclusion section):** Dedicated 2-3 sentences after the conclusion. "Ready to see what governed AI imagery looks like with your product? babystudio produces a sample set so your team can evaluate quality, governance, and workflow firsthand."

**Sidebar/banner CTA (design element):** Newsletter signup or content download offer placed alongside the content. Not disruptive. Always relevant to the post topic.

**Content upgrade CTA:** An enhanced version of the post's content offered in exchange for email. "Download the complete cost comparison spreadsheet" or "Get the full compliance checklist."

### CTA Language

- **Use:** "See your product with babystudio imagery." / "Get the complete guide." / "Talk to us about your production challenges."
- **Avoid:** "Sign up now." / "Don't miss out." / "Limited time offer." / Any urgency language.
- **Never:** Use more than two CTAs per post. One primary, one secondary (newsletter signup in sidebar).

- Format: WebP preferred, JPEG acceptable
- File size: Under 200KB
- Alt text: Descriptive, relevant, keyword-inclusive when natural

- Data visualizations: Charts, tables, and comparison graphics for data-heavy posts
- Process diagrams: For how-to and behind-the-scenes posts
- Screenshots: For platform-specific guides (Amazon listings, Meta ad examples)
- All images must have descriptive alt text

### Alt Text Format

- Describe what the image shows accurately
- Include the primary keyword if it describes the image naturally
- Length: 10-20 words
- **Good:** "Comparison table showing cost per image for traditional baby photography versus AI-generated production"
- **Bad:** "baby photography cost AI photography babystudio comparison image"

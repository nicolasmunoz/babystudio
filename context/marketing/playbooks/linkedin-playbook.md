# LinkedIn Channel Playbook

## Platform Overview

LinkedIn is babystudio's primary organic channel for reaching both Enterprise Emma (VP Marketing at major baby brands) and Agency Alex (Creative Directors at agencies serving baby brands). Startup Sam is also active here but skews more toward founder communities and DTC-specific networks.

LinkedIn serves three strategic functions for babystudio:
1. **Demand generation** -- Educate the market that AI infant imagery is viable, governed, and superior
2. **Credibility building** -- Establish babystudio as the category-defining authority in compliance-first AI baby content
3. **Pipeline contribution** -- Surface qualified prospects through engagement and inbound interest

---

## Platform-Specific Tone Adaptations

### Brand Voice on LinkedIn

babystudio's core voice is "confident but not arrogant, technical but accessible, innovative but trustworthy." On LinkedIn, this translates to:

**Professional but personable.** LinkedIn rewards a human voice over corporate speak. Write as a knowledgeable peer, not a press release.

**Adaptations from core brand voice:**
- **More conversational** than website copy -- use first person, ask questions, share observations
- **More opinionated** than documentation -- LinkedIn rewards contrarian takes and clear positions
- **More story-driven** than product pages -- lead with problems, experiences, and outcomes rather than features
- **Less formal** than industry publications -- shorter sentences, occasional fragments, direct address

**Tone calibration by content type:**
- Company page: Authoritative, informative, category-building
- Founder account: Personal, opinionated, behind-the-scenes, candid about the journey

**Words and phrases to use:** "governed," "production-grade," "compliance-first," "trust-building," "infant-specific," "purpose-built"

**Words and phrases to avoid:** "disrupting" (overused), "revolutionary" (arrogant), "game-changing" (empty), "AI-powered" without context (commodity language)

## Post Formats and When to Use Each

### Text-Only Posts
**When to use:** Strong opinions, personal stories, industry observations, questions to the audience
**Why it works:** Algorithm tends to favor native text. No distraction from the message. Feels personal and authentic.
**Best for:** Thought leadership positioning, contrarian takes, engagement-driving questions
**Length sweet spot:** 150-300 words (enough for substance, short enough to finish)

### Image + Text Posts
**When to use:** Showing AI-generated imagery examples, before/after comparisons, data visualizations, infographics
**Why it works:** Visual proof is critical for an AI imagery company. Demonstrates the product in-feed.
**Best for:** Product demonstrations, industry data posts, customer result spotlights
**Note:** Always use high-quality images. For babystudio, the imagery IS the credibility.

### Carousel Posts
**When to use:** Step-by-step frameworks, multi-point arguments, educational breakdowns, comparison content
**Why it works:** High dwell time. Each slide is a micro-commitment. Saves and shares tend to be higher.
**Best for:** How compliance-first AI works (process), cost comparison breakdowns, content pillar deep dives
**Slide count:** 7-10 slides. First slide = hook. Last slide = CTA.

### Poll Posts
**When to use:** Gauging industry sentiment, sparking debate, increasing engagement metrics
**Why it works:** Low-effort engagement. People vote even when they don't comment. Algorithm boost.
**Best for:** Industry opinions, market research, audience segmentation
**Frequency:** Maximum 1x per week. Overuse looks gimmicky.

### Articles (LinkedIn Newsletter/Long-form)
**When to use:** In-depth analysis, original research, comprehensive guides
**Why it works:** Positions babystudio as a serious thought leader. Subscribers get notified.
**Best for:** Quarterly industry analysis, compliance landscape updates, detailed case studies
**Frequency:** 1-2x per month maximum

### Video
**When to use:** Product demos, founder commentary, event recaps, process walkthroughs
**Why it works:** Algorithm favors video. Puts a human face on the brand.
**Best for:** Showing the generation process, founder perspective on industry trends
**Frequency:** 1-2x per month. Quality over quantity.

## Hook Formulas for First-Line Engagement

The first line of a LinkedIn post determines whether anyone reads the rest. These formulas are designed for babystudio's topics.

### Formula 1: The Uncomfortable Truth
**Structure:** "[Thing everyone assumes] is wrong. Here's why."
**Example:** "Baby photoshoots are a $2,500+ gamble. And most brands keep placing that bet because they don't know there's an alternative."

### Formula 2: The Specific Number
**Structure:** "[Specific number] + [surprising context]"
**Example:** "20 minutes. That's the legal maximum camera time for an infant on a commercial shoot. What happens in minute 21?"

### Formula 3: The Contrarian Question
**Structure:** "What if [accepted practice] is actually [negative framing]?"
**Example:** "What if requiring real babies in product photography isn't 'authentic' -- it's just unnecessary risk?"

### Formula 4: The Behind-the-Curtain
**Structure:** "Most people don't know [insider knowledge about the industry]."
**Example:** "Most people don't know that a single baby product image requires a welfare worker, a nurse, three backup babies, and a prayer."

### Formula 5: The Direct Challenge
**Structure:** "If you're still [common practice], you're [consequence]."
**Example:** "If you're still scheduling baby photoshoots 8 weeks out for a product launch, you're accepting a timeline your competitors won't."

### Formula 6: The Outcome Statement
**Structure:** "[Desirable outcome] without [expected cost]."
**Example:** "Enterprise-quality baby product imagery without a single diaper change, cancelled shoot, or expired usage license."

### Formula 7: The Observation
**Structure:** "I've noticed [trend/pattern] in [industry/context]. Here's what it means."
**Example:** "I've noticed that the best-converting baby product listings on Amazon all have one thing in common: a baby actually holding the product. Most brands can't produce that at scale."

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary Hashtags (Use 3-5 per post, rotate)

| Hashtag | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| #BabyProducts | Industry reach | All posts related to baby product marketing |
| #AIImagery | Technology positioning | Posts about AI generation capability |
| #ContentProduction | Production industry | Posts about production process/economics |
| #EcommerceMarketing | Buyer channel | Posts about conversion, PDPs, listing optimization |
| #BrandMarketing | General marketing | Broader thought leadership posts |
| #CPG | Enterprise reach | Posts targeting enterprise segment |
| #DTCBrands | DTC reach | Posts targeting emerging brands |
| #MarketingInnovation | Innovation positioning | Posts about the future of content production |
| #VisualContent | Content marketing | Posts about imagery strategy |
| #ComplianceFirst | Category ownership | Posts about governance and compliance |
| #AmazonSellers | E-commerce specific | Posts about Amazon PDP optimization |
| #ProductPhotography | Production industry | Posts comparing traditional vs. AI |
| #BabyBrand | Niche targeting | All posts |
| #GenerativeAI | Tech positioning | Posts about AI technology trends |

### Hashtag Rules
- Use 3-5 hashtags per post (not more -- looks spammy on LinkedIn)
- Place hashtags at the end of the post, not inline
- Always include at least one industry hashtag (#BabyProducts, #CPG, #DTCBrands) and one capability hashtag (#AIImagery, #ContentProduction)
- Do not use #babystudio unless we have established brand recognition
- Test new hashtags monthly; retire underperformers quarterly

---

## Engagement Protocol

### Responding to Comments

**Within 1 hour of posting:** Respond to every comment with substance. This signals to the algorithm that the post is generating conversation.

**Response tiers:**
- **Substantive comment:** Reply with additional insight, a follow-up question, or a specific data point. Never just say "Thanks!" or "Great point!"
- **Question:** Answer thoroughly. If it's a common question, note it as potential future content.
- **Skepticism/pushback:** Engage respectfully with evidence. Never get defensive. Skeptics who are converted become advocates.
- **Spam/irrelevant:** Ignore. Do not engage.

### When to DM

**Do DM when:**
- Someone asks a detailed question that would be better served in a private conversation
- A prospect (fits ICP) engages meaningfully with 2+ posts
- Someone shares a pain point that babystudio directly solves
- After a meaningful comment exchange (3+ replies), offer to continue the conversation

**Do NOT DM when:**
- Someone merely likes a post
- First-time engager with a single comment
- The person is clearly not in your ICP
- You have nothing specific to offer them

**DM approach:** Reference the specific post/comment. Ask a question, don't pitch. Example: "Your comment about the challenges of localizing baby imagery for APAC markets resonated. We've been working on exactly that problem. Would love to hear more about your experience -- is that something you'd be open to chatting about?"

### Share Strategy

- Share relevant third-party content 1-2x per week with original commentary (not just a reshare)
- When sharing babystudio blog posts, write a LinkedIn-native hook that stands alone -- don't just paste the link
- Engage with 5-10 posts from target accounts daily (company pages of prospects, industry leaders, adjacent companies)
- Comment on prospect posts before ever reaching out via DM or email

## Thought Leadership: Founder Account vs. Company Page

### Founder Account

**Purpose:** Personal credibility, relationship building, authentic voice, category evangelism

**Content mix:**
- 40% Industry opinions and observations
- 25% Behind-the-scenes of building babystudio
- 20% Educational content about AI imagery and compliance
- 15% Customer/market insights

**Voice:** First person. Personal. Candid about challenges. Willing to take positions. Not corporate.

**Example post openings:**
- "When I started babystudio, the first question everyone asked was..."
- "I spent last week talking to 5 baby brand marketers. Here's what surprised me..."
- "Unpopular opinion in the AI imagery space..."

### Company Page

**Purpose:** Brand credibility, product education, thought leadership content, company news

**Content mix:**
- 35% Educational (how-to, frameworks, data)
- 25% Product/capability demonstrations
- 20% Industry analysis and trends
- 10% Company milestones and news
- 10% Customer stories and results

**Voice:** Third person or "we." Authoritative. Data-driven. Less personal, more institutional.

**Example post openings:**
- "The economics of baby product photography are changing. Here's what the data shows."
- "New from babystudio: how compliance-first AI imagery meets enterprise legal requirements."
- "3 reasons baby brands are rethinking their content production stack."

### Coordination Rules
- Founder and company page should not post the same content
- Founder can reshare company page posts with personal commentary
- Company page should not reshare founder posts (looks small)
- Stagger posting -- if founder posts Tuesday AM, company page posts Thursday AM

## Content Templates

### Template 1: Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: State the problem]

[Agitation: Make the pain vivid with specifics]

[Solution: Present the alternative without hard selling]

[CTA: Engagement question or soft next step]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
A baby product photoshoot costs $2,500+ per usable image.

But cost isn't even the real problem.

It's the unpredictability. You book a studio. Hire a welfare worker. Schedule
a nurse. Line up 3 backup babies because the first might cry, sleep, or get sick.

You get a 20-minute window. If the baby doesn't cooperate, you're rebooking
everything. Timeline blown. Budget wasted.

And even when it works? Usage rights expire in 6-12 months. Then you do it
all over again.

There's a reason baby product imagery is the most expensive, least reliable
content production in consumer marketing.

We built babystudio because we think that's a solvable problem.

What's the most expensive content your brand produces?
```

### Template 2: Story-Lesson-CTA

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: Start with a specific moment or conversation]

[Story: Brief narrative with concrete details]

[Lesson: What this reveals about the industry/problem]

[CTA: What the audience should take away or do]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
"We cancelled the shoot. Again."

A brand director told me this last month. Third cancelled baby shoot
in a row. First baby had a cold. Second baby screamed for 20 minutes
straight. Third time, the parents no-showed.

Three attempts. Zero usable images. $7,500 in sunk costs.

The lesson isn't that baby shoots are hard. Everyone knows that.

The lesson is that brands have accepted this as normal. They budget
for failure. They build 4-week buffers into launch timelines just
for photography.

What if the production method is the problem, not the execution?

If you manage baby product content production, I'd love to hear:
how many shoots go as planned?
```

### Template 3: Contrarian Take

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: State the conventional wisdom, then challenge it]

[Argument: 2-3 supporting points]

[Nuance: Acknowledge the counterargument briefly]

[Position: Restate your stance clearly]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
"Real babies create more authentic imagery."

I hear this constantly. And I think it confuses authenticity
with production method.

Parents don't care whether the baby in the product image is "real."
They care whether the imagery looks trustworthy, safe, and realistic.

Three things that actually drive trust:
1. Baby is the right age for the product
2. Product is positioned correctly and safely
3. Expression is natural and believable

You can achieve all three without a live infant on set.
You cannot guarantee any of the three WITH a live infant on set.

I'm not saying traditional photography is bad.
I'm saying it's not inherently more authentic than governed AI imagery.

The authenticity is in the accuracy, not the production method.

Agree? Disagree? I want to hear from people who manage this.
```

### Template 4: Industry Data + Insight

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: Lead with a specific, surprising number]

[Context: What the data means]

[Analysis: Your interpretation -- what most people miss]

[Implication: What should change based on this]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
Baby brands spend 5x more per image than any other CPG category.

Here's why:

Standard CPG product shot: $200-500 per image
Baby product shot with infant talent: $2,500+ per image

The markup isn't for better cameras or fancier studios.

It's the compliance tax:
- Welfare worker: required by law in most states
- On-set nurse: standard for infant talent under 6 months
- Backup babies: typically 2-3 booked per shoot
- Permits: child performance permits per jurisdiction
- Usage renegotiation: every 6-12 months

This isn't a production problem. It's a structural cost that's
baked into the category.

The brands that figure out how to produce trust-building imagery
without this overhead will have a permanent cost advantage.

How does your brand handle baby content production costs?
```

### Template 5: Behind-the-Scenes

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: Share something most people don't see]

[Detail: Specific, concrete description of the process/decision/challenge]

[Reflection: What you learned or why it matters]

[Invitation: Bring the audience into the conversation]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
Building AI infant imagery is 20% generation and 80% governance.

Most people think the hard part is making the image look real.

It's not. The hard part is making sure every image is safe to use.

Here's what we check before a single image ships:

- Age-use alignment: Is the depicted age appropriate for the product?
- Safe positioning: Is the product shown being used correctly?
- Expression calibration: Is the expression natural for the depicted age?
- Demographic accuracy: Does the representation match the target market?
- Disclosure readiness: Is the image documented for platform compliance?

We built these checks into our production process from day one.
Not because regulators told us to. Because trust is the product.

If you're evaluating AI imagery for baby products, ask your vendor:
what governance do you apply to infant-specific content?

The answer will tell you everything.
```

### Template 6: Customer Result Spotlight

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: Lead with the outcome/result]

[Context: Brief description of the customer's situation before]

[What we did: High-level description (not a product pitch)]

[Result: Specific, measurable outcome]

[Takeaway: What others can learn from this]
```

**babystudio Example:**

```
40 product images. 6 demographic variations each. Delivered in 5 days.

A DTC baby brand came to us before their Amazon launch.

Their situation: 8 new SKUs. Zero baby imagery. Launch in 3 weeks.
Traditional production timeline? 6-8 weeks minimum.

They needed images that showed real babies using their products.
In multiple demographics. With compliant usage rights.

We produced their full image library in under a week.

Every image governed for age-use alignment and safe positioning.
Every asset delivered with compliance documentation.

Result: They launched on time. With imagery that matched brands 10x their size.

The gap between enterprise-quality imagery and startup budgets
is closing. Fast.

What's the tightest content production timeline you've faced?
```

### Template 7: Question/Poll

**Structure:**
```
[Context: 1-2 sentences framing the question]

[Question: Clear, specific, easy to answer]

[Options (if poll): 3-4 options that reveal something useful]
```

**babystudio Example (Poll):**

```
Baby brands: what's your biggest challenge with product imagery?

(Curious to see where the industry stands.)

A) Cost -- shoots are too expensive for the volume we need
B) Compliance -- navigating child labor and platform rules
C) Speed -- production timelines don't match launch schedules
D) Consistency -- quality varies too much across shoots
```

**babystudio Example (Open Question):**

```
Genuine question for baby product marketers:

If you could produce unlimited baby product images at a fraction
of the cost of traditional shoots -- but the babies are AI-generated
and photorealistic -- would you?

What would need to be true for you to say yes?

Not selling anything here. Building something and want to understand
the real barriers.
```

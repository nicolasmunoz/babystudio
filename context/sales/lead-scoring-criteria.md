# Lead Scoring Criteria

## Overview

Lead scoring assigns a numerical value to every lead based on who they are, where they work, what they do, and what's happening in their market. The score determines how we treat each lead — from passive nurture to immediate sales outreach.

**Purpose:**

1. **Sales efficiency.** Sales time is the scarcest resource in an early-stage company. Scoring ensures that time is spent on leads most likely to convert.
2. **Appropriate engagement.** A VP Marketing at a $2B baby brand downloading our cost calculator deserves a different response than a marketing intern at a pet food company clicking a blog post. Scoring creates that distinction automatically.
3. **Funnel velocity.** By identifying high-intent leads faster, we compress the time from first engagement to demo to pilot to customer.
4. **Marketing-sales alignment.** Scoring creates a shared definition of "qualified." Marketing knows what to aim for. Sales knows what to expect.

**Scoring range:** 0-200+ points (uncapped on the upside to accommodate highly engaged, highly qualified leads)

**Update frequency:** Scores update in real-time based on behavioral triggers and decay on a 30-day cycle for inactive leads.

## Scoring Dimensions

Lead scores are composed of four independent dimensions. Each captures a different aspect of lead quality:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Max Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| **Demographic Fit** | Who is this person? | ~60 points |
| **Company Fit** | Is their company a match? | ~75 points |
| **Behavioral Engagement** | What actions have they taken? | Uncapped (ongoing) |
| **Timing Signals** | Are external conditions favorable? | ~75 points |

Demographic and Company Fit represent **static quality** — they don't change unless the person's role or company changes. Behavioral Engagement and Timing Signals represent **dynamic intent** — they fluctuate based on actions and market conditions.

A lead needs both quality and intent to be sales-ready. High fit + low engagement = nurture. Low fit + high engagement = disqualify or redirect. High fit + high engagement = sales handoff.

## Demographic Scoring

Demographic scoring evaluates the individual contact's role and decision-making authority.

### Title / Seniority

| Title | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| CMO | +25 | Ultimate marketing decision-maker. Highest authority. |
| VP Marketing | +20 | Primary decision-maker for imagery and production budgets. Our ideal buyer. |
| Founder / CEO | +20 | At DTC brands, founder is often the decision-maker. At enterprise, CEO is too senior for direct engagement but signals high-level interest. |
| Director (Marketing, Creative, E-commerce, Brand) | +15 | Key influencer, often owns the budget line. May be the practical decision-maker. |
| Creative Director | +15 | Controls visual standards and production decisions. Key champion at agencies. |
| Senior Manager | +12 | Involved in evaluation, can champion internally. |
| Manager | +10 | User-level evaluator. Can influence but rarely decides alone. |
| Coordinator / Specialist | +5 | Early-career. Unlikely to have budget authority but may be doing research for a superior. |
| Other / Unknown | +3 | Unknown roles get minimal score until clarified. |

### Department

| Department | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing | +15 | Core buyer department. |
| Creative / Design | +15 | Directly involved in imagery production decisions. |
| E-commerce | +10 | Owns product listings where imagery matters most. |
| Brand | +10 | Owns brand standards that govern imagery. |
| Product | +5 | Occasionally involved in product imagery decisions. |
| Operations | +3 | Rarely involved but may own production vendor relationships. |
| Other / Unknown | +0 | No score until department is identified. |

### Decision Authority

| Authority Level | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Final decision-maker (signs contracts) | +20 | Can approve a pilot or contract without additional approval. |
| Key influencer (recommends, shapes decision) | +15 | Makes the recommendation that the decision-maker follows. |
| User / evaluator (will use the product) | +10 | Provides input but doesn't control budget or approval. |
| Gatekeeper (controls access to decision-maker) | +8 | Can block or enable access. Worth cultivating. |
| Unknown | +5 | Default until authority level is assessed through conversation. |

---

## Company Scoring

Company scoring evaluates whether the organization matches our ideal customer profile.

### Company Revenue (Baby Category)

| Revenue Range | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| $500M+ in baby category | +25 | Primary enterprise segment. Maximum imagery volume and budget. |
| $100M-$500M in baby category | +20 | Strong enterprise prospect. Meaningful imagery needs. |
| $50M-$100M | +15 | Mid-market. Good fit for Growth tier. |
| $5M-$50M | +10 | DTC/emerging brand segment. Starter or Pilot Pack fit. |
| $1M-$5M | +5 | Early-stage. May not have budget yet. Monitor for growth. |
| <$1M or unknown | +2 | Too early unless strong growth signals present. |

### Industry

| Industry | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Baby / infant products (primary business) | +25 | Perfect fit. Baby imagery is our core competency. |
| CPG with baby product line | +20 | Large companies where baby is one of several categories. High potential. |
| Children's products (ages 0-5) | +15 | Adjacent to our core but still relevant. |
| Agency serving baby brands | +15 | Channel partner opportunity. |
| Retail / marketplace (baby category) | +10 | Indirect buyer. May need imagery for private label or platform content. |
| Children's products (ages 5+) | +5 | Outside our infant talent range but may have baby-adjacent needs. |
| Other industry | +0 | Not a fit unless baby connection is identified. |

### Segment Match

| Segment | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Primary: Enterprise baby brand | +20 | Highest-value segment. Longest sales cycle but largest contracts. |
| Secondary: DTC / emerging baby brand | +15 | Faster sales cycle. Growth potential and referral value. |
| Tertiary: Agency serving baby brands | +10 | Partnership model. Value is in client access. |
| No clear segment match | +0 | Requires further qualification before scoring. |

### E-commerce Presence

| Presence Level | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Strong Amazon + DTC presence | +10 | Maximum imagery demand across channels. |
| Growing e-commerce (expanding listings) | +5 | Increasing need, likely to scale imagery needs. |
| Minimal or no e-commerce | +0 | Lower imagery volume needs. |

## Behavioral Scoring

Behavioral scoring tracks what the lead actually does. This is the most dynamic dimension and the strongest indicator of near-term purchase intent.

### Website Engagement

| Action | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Visited pricing page | +15 | Strongest website intent signal. Evaluating cost. |
| Visited case studies / results page | +10 | Evaluating outcomes. Solution-aware. |
| Visited about / contact page | +10 | Evaluating the company. Considering outreach. |
| Visited multiple blog posts (3+) | +10 | Sustained interest. Learning about the space. |
| Visited a single blog post | +5 | Initial interest. Awareness stage. |
| Homepage only | +2 | Minimal engagement. May be accidental or early curiosity. |
| Return visit (came back within 7 days) | +8 | Re-engagement indicates sustained interest. |
| Visited 5+ pages in a single session | +10 | Deep exploration. Strong interest signal. |

### Content Engagement

| Action | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Downloaded a lead magnet | +20 | Exchanged contact info for content. Meaningful commitment. |
| Downloaded multiple lead magnets | +30 | Deep engagement across multiple topics. |
| Subscribed to blog / newsletter | +10 | Opted in for ongoing communication. |
| Multiple blog reads (without download) | +10 | Interested but not ready to exchange info. |
| Shared our content on social media | +15 | Amplification = endorsement. Also expands reach. |
| Commented on blog or social post | +10 | Active engagement beyond passive consumption. |

### Direct Engagement

| Action | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Requested a demo | +30 | Highest-intent action. Immediate sales handoff. |
| Requested sample pack | +25 | Ready to see product applied to their brand. Very high intent. |
| Replied to an email (positive) | +15 | Direct engagement. Conversation started. |
| Replied to an email (neutral/question) | +10 | Engaged but not yet committed. |
| Sent a LinkedIn message | +10 | Proactive outreach. Good signal. |
| Attended a webinar or event | +10 | Invested time. Interested in learning more. |
| Referred us to a colleague | +20 | Internal champion behavior. Very strong signal. |
| Called or left a voicemail | +15 | High-effort outreach. Strong intent. |

### Email Engagement

| Action | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Opened an email | +2 | Basic engagement. May be habitual. |
| Clicked a link in an email | +5 | Active engagement. Interested in specific content. |
| Replied to an email | +15 | Direct conversation. Strong signal. |
| Forwarded an email internally | +10 | Sharing with colleagues = building internal consensus. |
| Opened 3+ emails in a sequence | +5 | Consistent engagement. Following the sequence. |
| Clicked on pricing/demo link in email | +10 | High-intent click. Specific interest in next steps. |

---

## Timing Signal Scoring

Timing signals are external events that indicate a company may be more likely to buy now. These are researched and added manually (or via automated monitoring tools as they become available).

| Signal | Points | Where to Find It | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| New product launch announced | +20 | Press releases, Amazon new listings, social media | New products need new imagery. Natural buying window. |
| Market expansion announced | +15 | Press releases, SEC filings, trade publications | New markets = localization needs = our sweet spot. |
| Usage rights likely expiring (12-month cycle) | +15 | Industry knowledge, contract timing assumptions | Natural re-evaluation moment for imagery sourcing. |
| Job posting for creative/content role | +10 | LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, company careers page | Building content team = investing in content production. |
| Funding round announced | +10 | Crunchbase, TechCrunch, press releases | Fresh capital often allocated to brand and marketing. |
| Competitor using AI imagery | +10 | Competitive monitoring, LinkedIn, trade publications | Competitive pressure to evaluate AI alternatives. |
| Agency change or RFP activity | +10 | Trade publications, LinkedIn signals | Vendor reevaluation window. Open to new relationships. |
| Brand refresh or rebrand announced | +10 | Press releases, social media, new website | Rebrand = new imagery across all channels. |
| Conference attendance (baby/marketing) | +5 | Event attendee lists, LinkedIn posts, badge scans | Active in the space. Accessible at events. |
| Seasonal planning cycle (Q3 for Q1 campaigns) | +5 | Industry knowledge | Aligns outreach with budget planning windows. |

---

## Negative Scoring

Negative scoring prevents wasted effort on leads that will never convert and ensures disqualified contacts are removed from active outreach.

| Signal | Points | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor employee | -50 | Competitive intelligence risk. Do not engage. |
| Student / academic | -40 | No purchase authority or budget. Educational engagement only. |
| Wrong industry entirely (no baby/child connection) | -50 | Not a fit. Remove from all outbound. |
| Unsubscribed from email | -30 | Explicitly opted out. Respect the decision. Remove from email sequences. |
| Bounced email (hard bounce) | -20 | Invalid contact. Cannot reach. Remove from email sequences. |
| No engagement for 90+ days | -15 | Interest has lapsed. Move to re-engagement or remove. |
| Marked email as spam | -50 | Aggressive opt-out. Remove immediately. Do not re-engage via email. |
| Expressed "not interested" in reply | -20 | Respect their answer. Move to long-term nurture or remove. |
| Company disqualified (no baby products) | -50 | Organization does not match ICP. Remove from outbound. |
| Invalid or personal email (gmail, yahoo for enterprise) | -10 | May not be a real business lead. Lower priority until verified. |

## Score Thresholds

These thresholds determine how each lead is treated. Calibrate based on actual conversion data (see Review & Calibration section below).

| Score Range | Classification | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **0-25** | **Cold** | Marketing nurture only. Add to content distribution list. No sales outreach. |
| **26-50** | **Warm** | Increased nurture cadence. Personalized content recommendations. Invite to webinars/events. Marketing monitors for score increases. |
| **51-75** | **Hot** | Sales notification triggered. Personalized outreach from sales within 48 hours. Research checklist completed. Priority content engagement. |
| **76+** | **Sales-Ready** | Immediate sales handoff. Priority response SLA: 2 hours during business hours. Personalized demo invitation. Full research brief prepared. |

### Threshold Behavior Rules

- A lead that crosses from Warm to Hot triggers an automated notification to sales.
- A lead that crosses from Hot to Sales-Ready triggers an immediate sales task with a 2-hour SLA.
- A lead that drops from Hot to Warm (due to decay) is returned to marketing nurture with a note.
- A lead that reaches Sales-Ready and then drops below 51 (due to decay without engagement) is flagged for re-engagement sequence.

---

## Handoff Criteria

When a lead crosses the Sales-Ready threshold (76+), marketing hands off to sales with the following information package:

### Required Handoff Information

1. **Contact details:** Name, title, company, email, phone, LinkedIn profile
2. **Lead score breakdown:** Total score + breakdown by dimension (demographic, company, behavioral, timing)
3. **Engagement history:** Every touchpoint — content downloads, email interactions, website visits, event attendance
4. **Research brief:** Completed research checklist from `outbound-target-list.md`
5. **Company context:** Segment classification, estimated revenue, baby product lines, key competitive position
6. **Pain point hypothesis:** Based on engagement patterns and research, what is this lead's likely primary pain point?
7. **Recommended approach:** Suggested opening message or approach based on persona and engagement history
8. **Content consumed:** List of all lead magnets downloaded, blog posts read, emails clicked
9. **Timeline context:** Any timing signals identified (product launches, funding, market expansion)
10. **Internal champion status:** Is there a secondary contact at the same company? Are they multi-threaded?

### Sales SLA

| Lead Classification | Response SLA | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Sales-Ready (76+) | 2 hours (business hours) | Personalized email or call within 2 hours |
| Hot (51-75) | 48 hours | Personalized outreach within 2 business days |
| Demo request (any score) | 2 hours | Immediate response and scheduling |
| Sample pack request (any score) | 24 hours | Acknowledge and begin production |

---

## Score Decay Rules

Scores must decay over time to reflect that interest fades if not reinforced. Without decay, the database would fill with artificially high-scored leads who engaged once months ago.

### Decay Schedule

| Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Base decay rate** | -5 points per 30 days of no engagement |
| **Decay floor** | Score cannot decay below 0 |
| **Decay applies to** | Behavioral scoring only. Demographic and Company Fit scores do not decay. |
| **Timing signals decay** | Timing signal points decay at -5 per 30 days after the initial 90-day relevance window |
| **Decay reset** | Any new engagement (email open, website visit, content download, reply) resets the decay clock to 0 |
| **Re-engagement boost** | When a decayed lead re-engages, add +5 bonus points on top of the normal engagement score (recognizes the significance of returning) |

### Decay Examples

- Lead scores 82 (Sales-Ready) on March 1. No engagement for 60 days. Score decays to 72 (Hot). Sales is notified of the downgrade. Lead enters re-engagement sequence.
- Lead scores 45 (Warm) on January 1. No engagement for 120 days. Score decays to 25 (Cold). Lead is moved to passive nurture only.
- Lead scores 30 (Warm) on April 1. Opens an email on April 25. Decay clock resets. Score increases to 32 (Warm) with the email open. No decay for another 30 days.

## Implementation Notes

### CRM Fields Required

Set up these fields in your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) to support automated scoring:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `lead_score_total` | Number | Total composite score |
| `lead_score_demographic` | Number | Demographic dimension subtotal |
| `lead_score_company` | Number | Company dimension subtotal |
| `lead_score_behavioral` | Number | Behavioral dimension subtotal |
| `lead_score_timing` | Number | Timing signals subtotal |
| `lead_classification` | Dropdown (Cold/Warm/Hot/Sales-Ready) | Current classification based on thresholds |
| `last_engagement_date` | Date | Last behavioral engagement for decay calculation |
| `decay_active` | Boolean | Whether decay is currently being applied |
| `handoff_date` | Date | When lead was handed to sales |
| `handoff_score` | Number | Score at time of handoff |
| `segment` | Dropdown (Enterprise/DTC/Agency) | Segment classification |
| `primary_pain_point` | Text | Hypothesized pain point |
| `timing_signals` | Multi-select | Active timing signals |

| Score crosses 76 (Hot to Sales-Ready) | Immediate sales notification with 2-hour SLA. Generate handoff brief. |
| Score drops below 51 (Hot to Warm) | Notify sales of downgrade. Return to marketing nurture. |
| Score drops below 26 (Warm to Cold) | Remove from active nurture. Add to re-engagement queue. |
| Negative score reaches -50 or below | Auto-disqualify. Remove from all sequences. Flag for review. |
| Demo request (any score) | Override: Immediately notify sales regardless of score. |
| Decay trigger (30 days no engagement) | Apply -5 decay. Recalculate classification. |

### Integration Points

- **Website analytics (Google Analytics, Segment):** Page visits, session depth, return visits feed behavioral scoring
- **Email platform (HubSpot, Mailchimp):** Opens, clicks, replies, forwards feed email engagement scoring
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** Connection acceptance, message replies, profile views
- **CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce):** Central score storage, automation engine, reporting
- **Enrichment tools (Clearbit, ZoomInfo):** Auto-populate demographic and company scoring fields
- **News monitoring (Google Alerts, Mention):** Timing signal detection for target accounts

## Review & Calibration

Lead scoring is a model, not a truth. It must be calibrated against real conversion data to remain useful.

### Monthly Review

**Frequency:** First week of every month
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes
**Participants:** Sales lead + marketing lead

**Review checklist:**
1. How many leads reached Sales-Ready (76+) this month?
2. Of those, how many converted to demo? To pilot? To customer?
3. Were any conversions from leads scored below 51? (Indicates scoring undervalues certain signals)
4. Were any Sales-Ready leads clearly unqualified? (Indicates scoring overvalues certain signals)
5. What is the average score of leads that converted to demo? To customer?
6. Are decay rules removing leads too aggressively or not aggressively enough?

### Quarterly Model Adjustment

**Frequency:** Every 3 months
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Purpose:** Adjust point values and thresholds based on conversion data

**Adjustment process:**
1. Pull all leads that converted to customer in the past quarter. Analyze their scoring profile at time of handoff.
2. Pull all leads that reached Sales-Ready but did not convert. Analyze their scoring profile.
3. Identify scoring dimensions that best predict conversion (these should be weighted higher).
4. Identify scoring dimensions that poorly predict conversion (these should be weighted lower or removed).
5. Adjust point values. Document changes and rationale.
6. Adjust thresholds if needed. If too many unqualified leads reach Sales-Ready, raise the threshold. If qualified leads are stuck in Warm, lower it.

### Data to Track for Calibration

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Average score at demo request | Indicates what score correlates with demo readiness |
| Average score at close (won) | Indicates what score correlates with purchase |
| Average score at close (lost) | Indicates what score correlates with disqualification |
| Time from Sales-Ready to demo | Measures handoff efficiency |
| Time from demo to close | Measures sales cycle length by score |
| Conversion rate by score band | Validates threshold accuracy |
| Top 3 scoring dimensions for closed-won leads | Identifies most predictive signals |
| False positive rate (Sales-Ready but disqualified) | Measures scoring accuracy |
| False negative rate (converted from below threshold) | Measures scoring sensitivity |

## How to Use This Document

1. **Initial setup:** Configure CRM fields listed in Implementation Notes. Set up automation triggers for threshold crossings and decay.

2. **Score existing leads:** Apply demographic and company scoring to every contact currently in the database. Behavioral scoring starts accumulating from implementation date forward.

3. **Daily operation:** Scoring runs automatically via CRM automation. Sales reviews the Hot and Sales-Ready queues daily. Marketing monitors scoring trends weekly.

4. **When a new lead enters the system:** Demographic and company scores are applied immediately (via enrichment tools or manual entry). Behavioral scoring begins accumulating with first engagement. Timing signals are added through manual research or automated monitoring.

5. **When sales receives a handoff:** Review the handoff brief. Verify the scoring makes sense given what you know. Reach out within SLA. Log the outcome to feed calibration data.

6. **Monthly:** Run the monthly review checklist. Adjust individual lead scores if new information invalidates previous scoring.

7. **Quarterly:** Run the full calibration process. Update point values and thresholds. Document all changes in a scoring changelog.

8. **Coordinate with other sales documents:**
   - Target list priorities (`outbound-target-list.md`) should align with company fit scoring
   - Lead magnet downloads (`lead-magnet-strategy.md`) trigger behavioral scoring
   - Email nurture engagement (`email-nurture-sequences.md`) feeds email engagement scoring
   - Pricing discussions (`pricing-framework.md`) indicate Solution-Aware or Product-Aware stage

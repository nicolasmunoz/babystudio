# Case Study Template and Examples

This document provides the standard template for babystudio case studies, writing guidelines, metrics frameworks, and three hypothetical case studies written in all format versions. Use this as the definitive reference for creating customer success stories.

**Companion documents:**
- One-Pager (`context/sales/one-pager.md`) -- proof points for sales leave-behinds
- Messaging Framework (`context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`) -- persona-specific messaging
- Brand Guidelines (`context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`) -- voice, tone, terminology

---

## Standard Template

Every babystudio case study follows this six-section structure. Each section has a specific purpose and should appear in order.

### Section 1: At a Glance

A scannable summary for executives who will not read the full case study. This section stands alone.

**Required elements:**
- Customer name (or anonymized descriptor if NDA)
- Customer segment (enterprise / DTC / agency)
- Industry or product category
- Challenge in one sentence
- Solution in one sentence
- 3-4 headline results with specific numbers
- Timeline (project duration)
- babystudio products/services used

**Format:** Sidebar or highlighted box. No more than 100 words.

---

### Section 2: The Challenge

Establishes the pain point and makes the reader recognize their own situation. This is the emotional entry point.

**Required elements:**
- Customer's business context (who they are, what they sell, their market position)
- The specific problem they faced with baby content production
- Quantified impact of the problem (dollars, time, missed opportunities)
- What they had tried before (and why it was not working)
- Stakes: what would happen if the problem remained unsolved

**Length:** 150-250 words.

**Writing approach:** Start with the business situation, then narrow to the specific production problem. Use concrete numbers, not vague frustrations. End with the stakes to create tension.

---

### Section 3: The Solution

Describes what babystudio delivered and how. This is the "how we helped" section.

**Required elements:**
- How the customer discovered or was introduced to babystudio
- Scope of the engagement (pilot or full project, number of images, markets)
- Specific babystudio capabilities used (governance, product integration, localization, compliance documentation)
- The process: from brief to delivery, including any collaboration touchpoints
- Any initial concerns the customer had and how they were addressed

**Length:** 200-300 words.

**Writing approach:** Focus on the experience, not just the deliverable. Describe the process as a partnership, not a transaction. Mention governance and compliance naturally, not as an afterthought.

---

### Section 4: The Results

The proof. This is the section that gets shared internally by the customer's champion.

**Required elements:**
- 3-5 quantified results with specific numbers
- Before vs. after comparison on key metrics
- Timeline to results
- Unexpected or additional benefits the customer experienced
- Qualitative impact (how it changed their operations, confidence, or strategy)

**Length:** 150-250 words.

**Writing approach:** Lead with the most impressive number. Present results in descending order of impact. Use before/after framing whenever possible. Include at least one result that is not purely financial (speed, confidence, capability).

---

### Section 5: Key Takeaway

A single-sentence summary of the lesson this case study teaches. This is the "so what" that makes the case study useful beyond the specific customer.

**Format:** One sentence, bolded. Should be broadly applicable to the target segment.

**Examples:**
- "Governed AI imagery does not just reduce production costs -- it eliminates the operational constraints that limited how many markets a brand could serve."
- "The ROI of product-integrated baby imagery is measured in conversion rate improvement, not just production cost savings."

---

### Section 6: What They Said

A direct quote from the customer that captures the impact in their own voice.

**Required elements:**
- Direct quote (2-4 sentences)
- Attribution: name, title, company (or anonymized equivalent)
- The quote should convey both the rational and emotional impact

**Writing approach:** The best quotes describe a before-and-after transformation, not just satisfaction. "We went from X to Y" is more powerful than "We were happy with the results."

---

## Format Versions

Every case study is produced in three formats for different uses.

### Full Version (800-1,200 words)

**Use:** Website case study page, downloadable PDF, sales collateral, email attachment for mid-to-late funnel prospects.

**Structure:** All six sections in full. Includes pull quotes, data callouts, and visual elements.

**Layout guidance:**
- At a Glance box at top right or as a sidebar
- The Challenge and The Solution as narrative text with subheadings
- The Results as a combination of narrative and highlighted data points
- Key Takeaway as a full-width callout
- What They Said as a closing quote block

---

### One-Page Summary (250-400 words)

**Use:** Sales leave-behind, one-pager attachment, quick-reference for sales conversations, internal sharing by customer champion.

**Structure:** Compressed version of all six sections. No section exceeds 2-3 sentences.

**Layout guidance:**
- At a Glance as a header block with key metrics
- Challenge, Solution, Results as tight paragraphs (2-3 sentences each)
- Key Takeaway and quote as closing elements
- Fits on a single printed page or a single screen scroll

---

### Social Snippet (150 words)

**Use:** LinkedIn posts, email teasers, social proof in presentations, ad copy foundations.

**Structure:** Challenge (1 sentence) -> Solution (1 sentence) -> Results (2-3 key numbers) -> Quote or takeaway (1 sentence).

**Layout guidance:** Designed to be self-contained. No additional context needed. Links to full case study for depth.

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Lead With the Result

The first sentence the reader encounters (in any format) should be the most compelling result. Do not bury the outcome behind setup. In the full version, the At a Glance section handles this. In shorter formats, the opening sentence does.

**Do:** "A global diaper brand reduced baby content production costs by 65% and expanded from 3 markets to 8 in half the time."
**Do not:** "A global diaper brand was facing challenges with their traditional baby photography workflow."

### Use Specific Numbers

Vague results are forgettable. Specific numbers are shareable. Every result should include a number.

**Do:** "Production costs dropped from $1.2M annually to $420,000 -- a 65% reduction."
**Do not:** "Production costs decreased significantly."

**Do:** "Turnaround time went from 6-8 weeks to 12 business days."
**Do not:** "Projects were completed much faster."

### Include the Emotional Journey

Case studies that only present data feel clinical. Include the human element: the frustration of the old approach, the skepticism that preceded adoption, the relief or excitement when results arrived.

**Do:** "Their creative director initially questioned whether AI imagery could meet the brand's quality bar. After reviewing the first production batch blind-labeled alongside traditional photography, she could not distinguish which was which."
**Do not:** "The creative team approved the quality."

### Short Paragraphs, Clear Transitions

No paragraph should exceed 4 sentences. Use transitional phrases that move the reader forward: "That changed when..." / "The impact was immediate." / "Within the first month..."

### Brand Voice Consistency

All case studies follow babystudio brand voice: authoritative but approachable, precise, confident without arrogance. Use "babystudio" (lowercase b), not "BabyStudio" or "Baby Studio." Refer to our output as "AI-generated imagery" or "governed imagery," never "fake babies" or "artificial babies."

---

#### The Challenge

One of the world's largest diaper manufacturers was preparing its most ambitious expansion in five years: simultaneous product launches across Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The regional marketing team had a clear mandate and an aggressive timeline -- imagery for all five markets needed to be production-ready within a single quarter.

The traditional approach was untenable. Each market required a separate photoshoot with locally representative infant talent. The team had budgeted $1.2M for the year's production, but the five-market expansion alone would consume $600,000-$750,000 of that budget at a rate of $15,000-$25,000 per localized shoot. That left almost nothing for the brand's existing North American, European, and Latin American markets, which also needed refreshed imagery for the upcoming season.

Beyond cost, the timeline was the real constraint. Traditional production required 6-8 weeks per market: casting, permits, scheduling around infant availability, contingency days for failed shoots, post-production, and legal clearance for talent usage rights. Running five markets sequentially meant the last market would not have imagery for 30-40 weeks. Running them in parallel required coordinating five simultaneous production teams across different countries, time zones, and regulatory environments -- a logistical challenge the team had neither the capacity nor the appetite to manage.

The VP of Regional Marketing described the situation plainly: the expansion was being limited not by market demand or product readiness, but by the constraints of baby content production. The brand was leaving revenue on the table because they could not produce imagery fast enough.

---

#### The Solution

The brand's innovation team had been tracking AI-generated imagery developments and brought babystudio to the VP of Regional Marketing's attention. After an initial conversation, the team agreed to a structured pilot: 10 images featuring the brand's flagship diaper product with infant talent representing two of the five target markets -- Japan and Indonesia.

The pilot was designed to answer three questions: Was the quality indistinguishable from their traditional photography? Would the governance documentation satisfy their legal team? Could the process integrate with their existing creative review workflow?

babystudio produced the pilot set in 9 business days. Each image featured the brand's actual product on AI-generated infant talent governed for age-use alignment (6-9 month range appropriate for the product), safe positioning (correct diaper fit, natural body positioning), and demographic accuracy (ethnically representative without stereotyping). Full compliance documentation accompanied every asset: governance check records, AI disclosure guidance for e-commerce platforms in each market, and perpetual usage rights confirmation.

The brand's creative director reviewed the pilot imagery alongside traditional photography from their most recent North American shoot. She was unable to identify which images were AI-generated -- and said so in her evaluation report to the VP.

The legal team reviewed the compliance documentation in 3 business days, compared to their typical 2-3 week review cycle for traditional talent releases across international markets. Their assessment: babystudio's governance documentation was more thorough and more standardized than what they typically received from production partners.

With pilot validation complete, the team moved to full production. babystudio produced imagery for all five APAC markets, plus three additional markets (India, Australia, and the Philippines) that the team added once they realized the budget could accommodate them. Total production: 120 images across 8 markets, delivered in 12 business days.

---

#### The Results

- **65% cost reduction.** The 8-market production cost $168,000, compared to an estimated $480,000-$600,000 for equivalent traditional production across the same markets. The savings freed budget for the brand's existing market refreshes.
- **2-week turnaround per market.** All 8 markets received production-ready imagery within a 12-business-day window. The traditional timeline would have been 6-8 weeks per market sequentially, or 40+ weeks total.
- **3 additional markets covered.** The cost savings allowed the team to expand from 5 planned markets to 8 without additional budget approval. India, Australia, and the Philippines were added at marginal cost.
- **Perpetual usage rights.** The brand eliminated approximately $40,000 in annual rights renegotiation costs across all 8 markets. Rights are permanent and worldwide.
- **Legal review time reduced by 80%.** Compliance documentation was reviewed and approved in 3 days versus the typical 2-3 weeks for international talent releases.

The operational impact went beyond the numbers. The regional marketing team reported that for the first time, imagery production was not the bottleneck in their launch process. Product development, retail negotiations, and distribution logistics -- not content production -- determined the launch timeline.

---

#### Key Takeaway

**Governed AI imagery does not just reduce production costs -- it removes the operational ceiling on how many markets a brand can serve simultaneously.**

---

#### What They Said

> "We had accepted that imagery production would always be the slowest part of a market launch. babystudio changed that assumption entirely. We went from budgeting $150,000 per new market to under $25,000, and we got the imagery in days instead of months. Our board noticed. They asked why we had not done this sooner."

### ONE-PAGE SUMMARY (250-400 words)

#### Global Diaper Brand Expands to 8 Markets at 65% Lower Cost

*Hypothetical / Illustrative*

**At a Glance:** A top-5 global diaper manufacturer needed imagery for a 5-market APAC expansion but faced $600K+ traditional production costs and 6-8 week timelines per market. babystudio delivered governed, photorealistic imagery across 8 markets in 12 business days at 65% lower cost.

**The Challenge:** The brand had budgeted $1.2M for annual imagery production, but the APAC expansion alone would consume more than half at traditional rates ($15,000-$25,000 per localized shoot). Sequential production across 5 markets meant 30-40 weeks of timeline. Parallel production was logistically unmanageable across different countries and regulatory environments. Imagery production -- not product readiness -- was limiting the expansion.

**The Solution:** babystudio ran a 10-image pilot across two markets (Japan and Indonesia) to validate quality, governance, and legal review workflow. The creative director could not distinguish AI-generated images from traditional photography in a blind review. Legal approved compliance documentation in 3 days versus their typical 2-3 weeks. With validation complete, babystudio produced 120 images across 8 markets (3 more than originally planned) in 12 business days, with full demographic governance and compliance documentation per market.

**The Results:**
- 65% cost reduction: $168,000 vs. $480,000-$600,000 estimated traditional cost
- 12-business-day turnaround for all 8 markets (vs. 6-8 weeks per market traditionally)
- 3 additional markets added within original budget
- Perpetual usage rights eliminated $40,000 in annual rights renegotiation
- Legal review time reduced by 80%

**Key Takeaway:** Governed AI imagery removes the operational ceiling on how many markets a brand can serve simultaneously.

| **Services** | Starter tier, Launch Pack |

---

#### The Challenge

An organic baby food brand had built a loyal direct-to-consumer following through farmers markets and its own Shopify store, but Amazon was where the growth opportunity lived. The founder knew it. Her team knew it. Their investors knew it. The problem was the listings.

All five SKUs launched on Amazon with product-only photography: beautifully shot pouches against white backgrounds. The images were technically excellent -- well-lit, properly formatted, correctly sized for Amazon's requirements. But they were missing the one thing that baby food competitors at every price point had: babies eating the food.

Parents shopping for baby food on Amazon expect to see a baby interacting with the product. They want to see the right age range holding the pouch, the right texture being eaten, the right mess being made. That visual evidence of real-world use builds the trust that converts browsers into buyers. Without it, the brand's listings converted at 2.1% -- significantly below the category average of 5-7% for established brands with baby imagery.

The founder explored traditional photography. She received three quotes. The lowest was $9,000 for a single SKU -- a full-day baby shoot with welfare worker, nurse, permit, two backup infants, photographer, studio, and post-production. For five SKUs, the total came to $45,000-$60,000, plus $5,000-$15,000 annually in usage rights renewals. That was more than the brand's entire quarterly marketing budget.

The founder described the situation as a "visual glass ceiling" -- her products were competitive on quality, price, and reviews, but her listings looked like a startup competing against brands with ten times her budget. And in the scroll-and-click world of Amazon, that visual gap was costing her sales every day.

---

#### The Solution

The founder learned about babystudio through a DTC founder community where another baby brand had shared their experience. She reached out with a direct question: could babystudio produce Amazon-ready imagery with babies holding her actual food pouches, for all five SKUs, within her budget?

babystudio proposed a Launch Pack: 50 images across 5 SKUs (10 images per SKU), with each set including lifestyle shots (baby eating in a highchair, on a blanket, in a kitchen setting), studio shots (clean backgrounds for Amazon main images), and demographic variations (3 representations per SKU). The project was priced at the Starter tier: $12,000 total.

The brief process took 30 minutes. The founder sent product photos for each SKU and described her target customer: health-conscious parents, 6-12 month feeding stage, natural lifestyle contexts. babystudio provided the brief template, and the founder filled it out during a single coffee break.

Production delivered the first round in 4 business days. Each image featured an AI-generated infant in the appropriate 6-12 month age range, holding or interacting with the specific food pouch being depicted. The governance system ensured age-use alignment (the depicted age matched the product's intended feeding stage), safe positioning (correct pouch orientation, no choking risk depiction), and realistic interaction (appropriate hand grip for a baby of that developmental stage).

The founder requested minor adjustments on two images -- a different expression on one infant and a slight angle change on a pouch. Both revisions were completed within 24 hours. Final assets, including compliance documentation and Amazon-specific disclosure guidance, were delivered on day 7.

---

#### The Results

- **3.8x conversion rate improvement.** Within 30 days of updating listings with babystudio imagery, the brand's average conversion rate across all 5 SKUs increased from 2.1% to 8.0%, exceeding the category average.
- **$12,000 vs. $45,000+ traditional cost.** Total production cost was 73% lower than the lowest traditional photography quote, covering all 5 SKUs with 10 images each.
- **50 images in 7 business days.** The entire 5-SKU project was completed in one week, compared to 5-10 weeks for traditional shoots across five separate sessions.
- **Perpetual usage rights.** The brand will never pay for rights renewals, eliminating an estimated $5,000-$15,000 in annual licensing costs.
- **Revenue impact.** At the brand's average order value and traffic levels, the conversion improvement translated to an estimated $180,000 in additional annual Amazon revenue.

Beyond the numbers, the founder described a shift in how she thought about her brand's visual presence. Before babystudio, imagery was a cost center she minimized. After, it became a conversion lever she invested in strategically. She began planning seasonal variations (holiday contexts, outdoor summer settings) and A/B test variants (different expressions, different demographics) -- creative experimentation that would have been prohibitively expensive with traditional production.

---

#### Key Takeaway

**The ROI of product-integrated baby imagery is measured in conversion rate improvement, not just production cost savings. For DTC brands, the revenue upside dwarfs the production investment.**

---

#### What They Said

> "I had resigned myself to competing with product-only photos because I could not afford baby shoots. babystudio gave me 50 images for less than one traditional shoot would have cost for a single SKU. But the real win was the conversion rate -- 2.1% to 8.0%. That changed our entire Amazon trajectory."

### ONE-PAGE SUMMARY (250-400 words)

#### Organic Baby Food Brand Achieves 3.8x Conversion Lift on Amazon

*Hypothetical / Illustrative*

**At a Glance:** A $12M organic baby food brand was converting at 2.1% on Amazon with product-only imagery. Traditional baby photography quotes came in at $45,000+ for 5 SKUs. babystudio produced 50 product-integrated images for $12,000, driving conversion rates to 8.0% within 30 days.

**The Challenge:** The brand's Amazon listings featured technically excellent product-only photography, but parents expect to see babies eating baby food. Without infant imagery, the brand's 2.1% conversion rate sat well below the 5-7% category average. Traditional baby photoshoots were quoted at $9,000+ per SKU -- $45,000-$60,000 total, more than the brand's quarterly marketing budget.

**The Solution:** babystudio produced a 50-image Launch Pack across all 5 SKUs (10 images per SKU) at the Starter tier for $12,000 total. Each image featured AI-generated infant talent in the 6-12 month age range, interacting with the specific food pouch with governed age-use alignment and safe positioning. The entire project -- from 30-minute brief to final delivery with compliance documentation -- took 7 business days.

**The Results:**
- 3.8x conversion rate improvement: 2.1% to 8.0% within 30 days
- 73% cost reduction: $12,000 vs. $45,000+ traditional
- 50 images across 5 SKUs in 7 business days
- Perpetual usage rights (eliminating $5K-$15K annual licensing)
- Estimated $180,000 in additional annual Amazon revenue

**Key Takeaway:** The ROI of product-integrated baby imagery is measured in conversion rate improvement, not just production cost savings.

## Case Study 3: Agency -- Creative Agency Wins Baby Brand Pitch

*Hypothetical / Illustrative*

---

#### The Challenge

A respected mid-size creative agency had a problem they could not solve with better creative: they kept losing baby brand pitches. Three consecutive losses in twelve months, all to larger agencies with established production infrastructure. The feedback was consistent -- the agency's creative concepts were strong, but their production estimates were too high and their timelines were too long.

The math was straightforward. Baby product photography required welfare workers ($500-$800/day), infant talent fees ($500-$1,500/baby/day), backup babies ($1,000-$4,500/day), on-set nurses, permits ($500-$2,000), and studio rental -- before the photographer and creative team even arrived. A single shoot day cost $15,000-$25,000 and yielded 3-5 usable images. For a campaign requiring 60-80 images across multiple demographics and product lines, the production budget alone exceeded $200,000.

Larger agencies could absorb those costs through volume and established production relationships. The mid-size agency could not. Their production estimates reflected the true cost of traditional baby photography, and those costs made their total campaign pricing uncompetitive. The creative director was frustrated: "We were pitching the best concepts in the room and losing on production economics."

The agency's principals faced a strategic decision. Baby brands represented a growing and lucrative segment -- the global baby care market was expanding, and brands were increasing their content investment for e-commerce platforms. Walking away from the segment meant ceding a growth area to competitors. But continuing to pitch with traditional production economics meant continuing to lose.

---

#### The Solution

The agency's creative director discovered babystudio through an industry conference presentation on AI production capabilities. The proposition clicked immediately: if babystudio could deliver the production quality at 50-70% lower cost, the agency could win on both creative merit and production economics.

babystudio proposed a partnership model with clear boundaries. The agency would retain full creative direction, client relationships, and strategic ownership. babystudio would handle AI infant talent production and governance as a white-label production partner. From the client's perspective, the agency was delivering a full-service capability -- they did not need to know the production details any more than they needed to know which camera a traditional photographer used.

The onboarding took two weeks. babystudio aligned with the agency's brief formats, creative review process, and delivery standards. The creative director ran a test production: 10 images across two product categories and three demographics, briefed against the same standards they would use for any client. The results were reviewed by three senior creatives who were not told the imagery was AI-generated. All three rated the quality as production-ready for client presentation.

The real test came quickly. A major baby skincare brand with a $2M annual marketing budget issued an RFP. The agency had lost to a competitor on a similar pitch eight months earlier -- primarily on production cost. This time, the agency pitched with babystudio's production economics underlying their proposal: governed, photorealistic infant imagery at 55% lower production cost, with 5-7 day turnaround instead of 6-8 weeks, perpetual usage rights included, and compliance documentation as a standard deliverable.

The pitch deck included sample imagery produced by babystudio using comparable product references. The creative concepts remained the agency's own -- strategic, differentiated, and tailored to the client's brand. But the production cost section told a story that competing agencies could not match.

---

#### The Results

- **Won the $2M account.** The agency won the pitch against two larger competitors. The client cited three factors: creative quality, production economics, and the compliance documentation capability that no other agency had presented.
- **55% production cost reduction for the client.** The agency presented production costs 55% below traditional photography rates, passing a portion of the savings to the client while retaining improved margins.
- **Agency margins improved from 18% to 52%.** On traditional baby brand work, the agency's production margins averaged 18% after costs. With babystudio as the production layer, margins on the production component rose to 52%, increasing the account's profitability dramatically.
- **Client received 3x more imagery.** The production budget that would have yielded 25-30 images through traditional photography yielded 80+ images through babystudio, covering more demographics, more product lines, and more platform formats.
- **Delivery timelines compressed by 75%.** Campaigns that previously required 6-8 weeks for production were delivered in 10-14 business days, giving the client more time for strategic review and market testing.

The ripple effects extended beyond the single account win. The agency began positioning their AI production capability as a differentiator across all baby brand pitches. Within four months of the initial win, they had added two more baby brand clients who specifically cited the production capability as a deciding factor.

The creative director reported an unexpected benefit: creative ambition increased. When production was expensive and unpredictable, creative teams self-censored. They proposed concepts they knew could be executed within traditional constraints. With babystudio, creative teams began proposing broader demographic representation, more lifestyle contexts, and more A/B test variations -- knowing that production cost and feasibility would not kill the concept.

#### Key Takeaway

**For agencies, AI production partnerships are not a creative compromise -- they are a competitive weapon that wins accounts, improves margins, and expands what creative teams can propose.**

#### What They Said

> "We were the smallest agency in every pitch. We kept losing on production economics despite having the best creative in the room. babystudio changed the equation. We won a $2M account against agencies twice our size, and our margins on baby brand work nearly tripled. But the thing I did not expect was how it freed up our creative thinking. When production is cheap and fast, you stop self-censoring."

### ONE-PAGE SUMMARY (250-400 words)

#### Creative Agency Wins $2M Baby Brand Account With AI Production Partnership

*Hypothetical / Illustrative*

**At a Glance:** A 45-person creative agency had lost 3 consecutive baby brand pitches due to uncompetitive production costs. After partnering with babystudio as a white-label production partner, they won a $2M annual account, reduced client production costs by 55%, and improved agency margins from 18% to 52% on baby brand work.

**The Challenge:** Traditional baby photography made the agency's proposals uncompetitive. A single shoot day cost $15,000-$25,000 and yielded 3-5 usable images. For campaigns requiring 60-80 images, production budgets exceeded $200,000 -- pricing the agency out against larger competitors with volume production advantages. Three lost pitches in twelve months confirmed the pattern: strong creative, uncompetitive economics.

**The Solution:** babystudio partnered with the agency under a white-label model. The agency retained full creative direction and client relationships. babystudio handled AI infant talent production and governance as an invisible production layer. After a 2-week onboarding and a 10-image blind quality test (three senior creatives rated it production-ready without knowing it was AI-generated), the agency pitched a major baby skincare brand with babystudio production economics: 55% lower cost, 5-7 day turnaround, perpetual rights, and compliance documentation included.

**The Results:**
- Won $2M annual account against two larger agencies
- 55% production cost reduction passed to client
- Agency margins improved from 18% to 52% on baby brand production
- Client received 80+ images vs. 25-30 from traditional production at the same budget
- 75% compression in delivery timelines (10-14 days vs. 6-8 weeks)
- Two additional baby brand clients added within 4 months

**Key Takeaway:** AI production partnerships are a competitive weapon that wins accounts, improves margins, and expands creative ambition.

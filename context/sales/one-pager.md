# One-Pager: Sales Leave-Behinds

Three versions of the babystudio one-pager for different buyer personas. Each is designed as a standalone sales leave-behind that can be handed off after a meeting, sent as a follow-up attachment, or shared internally by the prospect.

---

## Version 1: Enterprise One-Pager

**Target audience:** VP Marketing, Creative Directors, Brand Managers at $500M+ baby brands (Enterprise Emma)
**Use:** Leave-behind after enterprise sales meeting, attachment to follow-up email, internal circulation by champion

---

### Headline

**Baby content production costs too much and takes too long. It does not have to.**

### Subheadline

babystudio delivers governed, photorealistic infant imagery with your products -- in days instead of months, at 50-70% lower cost, with compliance documentation built into every asset.

---

### The Problem

Enterprise baby brands face production constraints that no other product category tolerates:

- **The compliance tax.** Welfare workers, permits, nurses, and backup babies add a 5x cost markup to every shoot -- before a camera is turned on. The average enterprise baby shoot costs $15,000-$25,000 per day and yields 3-5 usable images.
- **Localization friction.** Every new market requires a separate shoot for demographic representation. Brands expanding into 5-10 markets face $50,000-$150,000+ in duplicated production costs per SKU.
- **The 20-minute window.** Infants are legally restricted to 20 minutes of camera time. 40-60% of shoots fail due to crying, sleeping, or illness -- and usage rights expire every 6-12 months, forcing renegotiation or reshoots.

---

### The Solution

babystudio is a production partner that replaces live infant talent with governed, photorealistic AI-generated imagery. Your actual products, held correctly and used safely, represented across any demographic -- with full compliance documentation included in every asset. We are purpose-built for the baby category, not adapted from a general-purpose AI platform.

---

### How It Works

| Step | What Happens | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Brief** | You define the product, target demographic, expression, positioning, and context. We provide a brief template for consistency. | Day 1 |
| **2. Produce** | AI-generated photorealistic imagery matching your specifications. Product integration is exact -- correct grip, orientation, and scale. Every image passes infant-specific governance checks. | Days 2-4 |
| **3. Deliver** | Final assets delivered with compliance documentation, AI disclosure guidance, and perpetual usage rights. Ready for legal review and commercial use. | Day 5-7 |

---

### Key Differentiators

- **Baby-specific governance.** Age-use alignment, safe positioning, and expression calibration built into every production run -- not bolted on after the fact. Your legal team reviews documentation, not ambiguity.

- **Product-integrated imagery.** Your actual products depicted in correct, safe use. Not generic babies near generic products. The grip, the angle, the interaction -- all governed for accuracy.

- **Perpetual usage rights.** No consent renegotiation. No 6-12 month expiration windows. No rights management overhead. Rights are included in production pricing and never expire.

- **Instant demographic flexibility.** Generate imagery for Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Berlin, and Lagos from a single brief. No additional shoots. No marginal cost. Consistent quality and brand standards across every market.

---

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Traditional Production | babystudio |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Cost per usable image** | $2,500-$8,000+ | $500-$1,500 |
| **Production timeline** | 4-8 weeks | 5-7 business days |
| **Localization (per market)** | $15,000-$25,000 | $500-$1,500 |
| **Usage rights** | 6-12 month terms, renegotiation required | Perpetual, included |
| **Shoot cancellation risk** | 20-30% reshoot rate | 0% -- no scheduling dependencies |

---

## Version 2: Emerging Brand One-Pager

**Target audience:** Founders, Marketing Leads at $5M-$100M DTC baby brands (Startup Sam)
**Use:** Leave-behind after founder conversation, cold outreach attachment, sample pack companion

---

### Headline

**Enterprise-quality baby imagery. Startup-friendly pricing.**

### Subheadline

Stop choosing between great imagery and your budget. babystudio produces photorealistic baby imagery with your products -- starting at $500 per image, delivered in days, with compliance handled.

---

### The Problem

Growing baby brands face an imagery gap that directly impacts conversion:

- **Traditional shoots are priced for P&G, not for you.** A single baby photoshoot costs $10,000-$25,000+ when you factor in welfare workers, permits, nurses, and backup babies. That is your entire quarterly marketing budget for 3-5 usable images.
- **Stock photography does not sell products.** Generic baby images do not show your product being used. Parents need to see a baby holding your bottle, wearing your clothing, using your product -- and stock cannot deliver that. Listings with product-integrated baby imagery convert 25-40% higher than product-only listings.
- **Compliance is a minefield without a legal team.** Child labor laws, platform disclosure requirements, usage rights management -- navigating this without in-house legal counsel is expensive and risky. One misstep can mean pulled listings or worse.

---

### The Solution

babystudio gives you the same photorealistic, product-integrated infant imagery that Fortune 500 brands use -- at a price that works for your stage. AI-generated baby talent with your actual products, governed for safety and compliance, delivered with perpetual usage rights and all documentation handled.

---

2. **We produce.** AI-generated photorealistic imagery with your product correctly integrated. Governed for age-use alignment and safe positioning.
3. **You use it everywhere.** Delivered with perpetual rights and compliance docs. Amazon, Shopify, Meta, TikTok -- use anywhere, forever.

## Version 3: Agency Partner One-Pager

**Target audience:** Creative Directors, Agency Principals at agencies serving baby brands (Agency Alex)
**Use:** Partnership conversation leave-behind, agency new business toolkit companion

---

### Headline

**A new production capability for your baby brand clients.**

### Subheadline

babystudio is a production partner, not a competitor. We handle AI infant talent and governance so your agency delivers more value, faster, and with less production risk.

---

### The Partnership Model

babystudio extends your production capabilities for baby brand clients. You maintain creative direction, client relationships, and strategic ownership. We handle the production and governance layer.

| Your Agency | babystudio |
|-------------|-----------|
| Creative strategy and direction | AI infant talent production |
| Client relationship management | Baby-specific governance and compliance |
| Brand standards and oversight | Product integration and demographic variation |
| Campaign planning and execution | Compliance documentation and disclosure guidance |
| Final approval and delivery to client | Perpetual usage rights management |

---

### Why This Matters for Your Agency

**Win more baby brand business.** Agencies offering AI-powered baby content production stand out in pitches. Position your team as the agency with a capability most competitors cannot match.

**Eliminate your riskiest productions.** Baby shoots have a 30-40% failure rate. The 20-minute window, crying babies, and compliance overhead make them your most unpredictable line item. babystudio removes that unpredictability entirely.

**Improve margins on baby brand accounts.** Reduce production costs by 50-70% for your clients while maintaining or improving your own margins. Predictable pricing means predictable profitability.

**Deliver demographic flexibility your clients need.** When a client needs localized imagery for six markets by next quarter, traditional production cannot deliver on time or on budget. babystudio generates it from a single brief with no marginal cost.

---

### The Revenue Opportunity

| Scenario | Traditional Approach | With babystudio |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Client production budget** | $150,000 annually | $150,000 annually |
| **Your production cost** | $120,000 (agency markup limited) | $55,000 (babystudio production) |
| **Your margin** | $30,000 (20%) | $95,000 (63%) |
| **Images delivered** | 50-60 | 100-150+ |
| **Markets covered** | 2-3 | 8-10+ |
| **Client satisfaction** | Unpredictable delivery | Consistent, on-time |

*Illustrative scenario. Actual margins depend on client pricing and scope.*

## Design Notes for All Versions

## Sequence 1: Enterprise Nurture

**Trigger:** Enterprise-segment lead downloads any lead magnet
**Duration:** 35 days, 7 emails
**Goal:** Move from content engagement to demo request
**From:** [Founder Name], babystudio

### Email 1 — Day 0: Deliver the Asset

**Subject:** Your [lead magnet name] is ready
**Preview text:** Plus a quick note on why we built this.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Here's the [lead magnet name] you requested: [link]

We built this because baby brands keep telling us the same thing — production costs are opaque, timelines are unpredictable, and compliance is getting more complex every year. We wanted to give marketing leaders a practical tool to cut through that.

A bit about us: babystudio produces AI-generated infant talent and product imagery for baby brands. We handle the governance, the compliance documentation, and the production infrastructure so your team gets campaign-ready images without the traditional shoot logistics.

No pitch here. Use the [lead magnet name], and if it's helpful, that's enough.

Talk soon,
[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Download link embedded in body
**Purpose:** Deliver value, introduce babystudio without selling. Establish the sender as a real person.

### Email 2 — Day 3: The Production Problem

**Subject:** The 20-minute window costs more than you think
**Preview text:** What happens when a baby decides they're done.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Here's a number that surprised us when we first dug into it: the average usable shooting window with an infant under 12 months is about 20 minutes.

Twenty minutes. Before fatigue, fussiness, or a diaper change shuts everything down.

Now multiply that constraint by every SKU, every demographic variant, every market you sell into. The real cost of baby product imagery isn't the photographer's day rate — it's everything that happens around those 20 minutes. The canceled shoots. The backup talent that didn't show. The images that looked great on set but failed compliance review afterward.

We've talked to marketing leaders at brands producing 200+ baby product images per year. The consistent theme: the cost per usable image is 2-4x what their budget line says.

If that resonates with your team's experience, I'd be happy to share how some brands are approaching this differently. No agenda — just a useful conversation.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Soft — reply to email for conversation
**Purpose:** Establish credibility by demonstrating deep understanding of the production problem. Create resonance.

### Email 3 — Day 7: The Compliance Advantage

**Subject:** Compliance as a competitive moat
**Preview text:** Platform policies are shifting. Governance is becoming a differentiator.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick thought I wanted to share.

Amazon, Meta, and Google have all updated their policies on AI-generated content over the past 18 months. The EU AI Act is creating new disclosure requirements. The FTC has signaled increased scrutiny on synthetic media in advertising.

For most brands, compliance is a cost center — something legal reviews after the fact. But the brands moving fastest right now are treating compliance as a differentiator. They're building governance into their production process from the start, not bolting it on later.

In baby products specifically, compliance is even more consequential. Age-appropriate positioning, safe sleep guidelines reflected in imagery, proper product-size-to-age alignment — these aren't just regulatory checkboxes. They're trust signals to parents who scrutinize every detail.

babystudio was built around this principle. Every image we produce comes with full governance documentation: age-use alignment verification, safe positioning confirmation, disclosure-ready metadata, and perpetual usage rights.

If compliance governance is something your team is thinking about, our compliance checklist might be a useful resource: [link to compliance checklist lead magnet]

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Link to compliance checklist (secondary lead magnet)
**Purpose:** Position babystudio's governance as unique and forward-thinking. Build authority on compliance.

### Email 4 — Day 12: Social Proof

**Subject:** 65% lower cost, 2-week turnaround
**Preview text:** What brands in your category are seeing with AI-generated imagery.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share what we're seeing from brands that have piloted AI-generated infant talent for their product imagery.

Across our initial engagements, the pattern is consistent:

- Production cost reduction of 55-70% compared to traditional shoots
- Turnaround from brief to delivered images: 1-2 weeks instead of 6-10 weeks
- Compliance documentation included at delivery — no separate legal review cycle
- Unlimited demographic and seasonal variations from a single production brief

One brand in the [relevant category — feeding/apparel/gear] space told us the biggest surprise wasn't the cost savings. It was the speed. Their product launch calendar had always been constrained by shoot scheduling. When imagery production dropped from 8 weeks to 10 days, their entire go-to-market accelerated.

These are still early results, and we're transparent about that. But the trajectory is clear enough that we're confident offering a pilot program to qualified brands.

Would a 15-minute conversation about what this could look like for [Company Name] be worth your time?

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply to schedule a call
**Purpose:** Provide concrete evidence of results. Create desire through specificity.

### Email 5 — Day 18: ROI Deep Dive

**Subject:** The math on baby product imagery
**Preview text:** Per-image economics, broken down.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this one short and specific.

Here's the per-image cost comparison we walk brands through:

Traditional baby product photoshoot: $2,500-$8,000+ per usable image (fully loaded — talent, studio, crew, compliance review, post-production, usage rights)

babystudio AI-generated imagery: $500-$1,500 per image depending on volume and customization level

That's before factoring in:
- No talent scheduling, cancellations, or weather delays
- No usage rights renewals (perpetual rights included)
- No separate compliance review cycle (governance built in)
- Variations (demographic, seasonal, setting) produced at marginal cost, not full reshoot cost

For a brand producing 100 images per year, the annual savings range from $100K to $500K+. For a brand producing 500+ images across multiple markets, the numbers are significantly larger.

We've put together a detailed pricing framework that breaks this down by volume tier. Happy to share it if it'd be useful for your planning.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply for pricing framework document
**Purpose:** Make the financial case undeniable. Offer the pricing framework as a value-add.

### Email 6 — Day 25: Demo Invitation

**Subject:** See your product with AI talent — takes a week
**Preview text:** We'll produce sample images with your actual products.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've shared a lot of information over the past few weeks. At this point, seeing is more useful than reading.

Here's what I'd like to offer: a 30-minute demo where we walk through babystudio's production process, show you examples relevant to [Company Name]'s product categories, and discuss what a pilot engagement would look like.

If there's interest, we can also produce 3-5 custom sample images using your actual products — no cost, no obligation. Most brands tell us that seeing their own products in AI-generated lifestyle imagery is the moment it clicks.

I have availability [next week / specific dates]. You can grab a time here: [calendar link]

Or if you'd prefer to loop in someone else from your team, just forward this along and I'll coordinate.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Calendar link for demo scheduling
**Purpose:** Direct conversion to demo. Make it easy, low-risk, and specific.

### Email 7 — Day 35: Personal Note / Soft Close

**Subject:** No pressure, [First Name]
**Preview text:** Just wanted to leave the door open.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've sent a few emails over the past month, and I want to be respectful of your time.

If baby product imagery production isn't a priority right now, I completely understand. Timing matters, and I'd rather be useful when the moment is right than be noise when it's not.

## Sequence 2: DTC Nurture

**Trigger:** DTC-segment lead downloads any lead magnet
**Duration:** 14 days, 5 emails
**Goal:** Move quickly from content engagement to sample pack or demo
**From:** [Founder Name], babystudio

### Email 1 — Day 0: Deliver Asset + "Launch Like a $100M Brand"

**Subject:** Your [lead magnet name] + a quick thought
**Preview text:** How emerging brands are outproducing the incumbents.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Here's the [lead magnet name] you downloaded: [link]

Quick thought while I have you: the brands winning on Amazon and DTC right now aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones with the best product imagery.

Parents make purchase decisions in seconds. They scroll past product-on-white. They stop for lifestyle imagery that shows their baby using the product. That's the gap.

babystudio helps baby brands produce professional lifestyle imagery with AI-generated infant talent. No photoshoots, no infant scheduling, no compliance headaches. Images that look like a $100M brand produced them — at a fraction of the cost and timeline.

More on that later. For now, hope the [lead magnet name] is useful.

[Founder Name]
babystudio

**CTA:** Download link in body
**Purpose:** Deliver the asset and plant the seed: imagery quality is the growth lever.

### Email 2 — Day 2: Before/After Quality Comparison

**Subject:** Product-only vs. lifestyle — the conversion gap
**Preview text:** What happens when parents can actually picture their baby using your product.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Here's something we see consistently across baby brand Amazon listings:

Brands with only product-on-white images convert at significantly lower rates than brands with lifestyle imagery showing the product in use with an infant. The gap is typically 15-30% in conversion rate, depending on category.

Makes sense when you think about it. A parent buying a sleep sack doesn't just want to see fabric and zippers. They want to see a baby sleeping peacefully in it. A parent buying a high chair wants to see a happy infant sitting in it at a real kitchen table.

The challenge has always been that producing those lifestyle images with real infants is expensive, slow, and logistically painful. That's exactly what babystudio solves.

We produce lifestyle images with AI-generated infant talent that are:
- Indistinguishable from professional photography in quality
- Customizable for any demographic, setting, or season
- Delivered in days, not months
- Fully compliant with platform and regulatory requirements

If you want to see what this looks like with [Company Name]'s products, reply with a product photo and we'll create a free sample.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply with product photo for free sample
**Purpose:** Demonstrate the value of lifestyle imagery and make the path to experiencing babystudio frictionless.

### Email 3 — Day 5: Speed and Iteration

**Subject:** Test 10 image variations this week
**Preview text:** Traditional shoots can't do this. Here's why speed matters.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

One of the things that surprises DTC founders most about AI-generated imagery: the iteration speed.

With traditional photography, testing a new image concept means booking a new shoot. That's weeks of lead time and thousands of dollars per attempt. So most brands test slowly, if at all.

With babystudio, you can:
- Test multiple demographic representations to see what resonates with your audience
- Try different settings and scenes (nursery, outdoors, kitchen, travel)
- Create seasonal variations without seasonal shoots
- A/B test hero images on Amazon in days instead of quarters

Speed isn't just about saving time. It's about learning faster. The brands that iterate fastest on their imagery are the ones that find what converts — and scale it before competitors catch up.

If you're planning a product launch or listing refresh in the next 60 days, now is the right time to explore what faster imagery production looks like.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Soft — plants the seed for time-sensitive engagement
**Purpose:** Reframe speed as a competitive advantage, not just a convenience.

### Email 4 — Day 9: Pricing Transparency

**Subject:** What baby product imagery actually costs
**Preview text:** Transparent pricing, no surprises.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I don't believe in hiding pricing until a sales call. Here's what babystudio costs:

**Starter (10-image minimum):** $500-$750 per image
Best for: Testing the waters. A single product line or listing refresh.

**Growth (25-image minimum):** $750-$1,000 per image
Best for: Multi-product imagery, seasonal campaigns, A/B testing at scale.

**Pilot Pack (5-10 images):** 30-40% discount off Starter pricing
Best for: First-time customers who want to see results before committing.

For comparison, a traditional baby product photoshoot runs $2,500-$8,000+ per usable image when you factor in talent, studio, crew, compliance, and post-production.

Every babystudio image includes:
- Full governance documentation
- Perpetual usage rights (no renewals)
- Demographic and setting customization
- Platform-ready formatting

The Pilot Pack is how most brands start. It's designed to be low-risk: a small batch of images so you can see the quality, test them on your listings, and measure the impact before scaling up.

Interested? Reply and I'll put together a Pilot Pack proposal for [Company Name].

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply for Pilot Pack proposal
**Purpose:** Remove pricing uncertainty. Make the Pilot Pack the natural next step.

### Email 5 — Day 14: Sample Pack Offer

**Subject:** Send us one product photo
**Preview text:** We'll show you what's possible. Free, no strings.

**Trigger:** Demo completed (any segment)
**Duration:** 14 days, 4 emails
**Goal:** Convert demo attendee into pilot customer
**From:** [Founder Name] or [Sales Lead], babystudio

### Email 1 — Day 0: Thank You + Recap

**Subject:** Great conversation, [First Name] — next steps inside
**Preview text:** Recap of what we discussed + relevant resources.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for taking the time today. I enjoyed learning about [specific thing discussed — e.g., your upcoming product launch / your team's imagery workflow / your Amazon listing refresh plans].

Here's a quick recap of what we covered:

- [Key point 1 discussed in demo — e.g., how babystudio's production process works from brief to delivery]
- [Key point 2 — e.g., governance and compliance documentation included with every image]
- [Key point 3 — e.g., Pilot Pack structure and timeline for your team]

A few resources that are relevant to our conversation:
- [Link to relevant lead magnet or blog post]
- [Link to pricing framework if discussed]
- [Link to sample gallery if shown during demo]

For next steps, I suggested [specific next step discussed — e.g., putting together a Pilot Pack proposal for your diaper line imagery / scheduling a follow-up with your creative director]. I'll have that ready by [date].

In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Sets expectation for next step with specific date
**Purpose:** Reinforce what was discussed. Demonstrate attentiveness. Maintain momentum.

### Email 2 — Day 2: Proposal + Address Top Concern

**Subject:** Your pilot proposal + a note on [their top concern]
**Preview text:** Proposal attached. And I wanted to address [concern] directly.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

As promised, here's the pilot proposal for [Company Name]: [link/attachment]

It includes:
- Scope: [X] images across [product lines discussed]
- Timeline: [X] weeks from brief to delivery
- Investment: [specific pricing based on discussion]
- What's included: Full governance documentation, perpetual usage rights, [X] rounds of revision

I also wanted to address something you raised during our demo: [their specific concern — customize based on actual demo conversation].

**If concern was quality/realism:**
This is the most common question we hear, and it's the right one to ask. The sample images we showed you during the demo are representative of production quality — not cherry-picked portfolio pieces. We also offer the Pilot Pack specifically so you can evaluate quality with your own products before any larger commitment. If the pilot images don't meet your standards, there's no obligation to continue.

**If concern was internal buy-in:**
Getting internal alignment is a real consideration, especially with new technology. A few things that help: our governance documentation gives legal and compliance teams the specifics they need. The pilot is designed to be small enough that it fits within most discretionary budgets. And the results — actual images with your products — are the most persuasive internal sell.

**If concern was AI disclosure/perception:**
This is something we think about deeply. Our position: proactive, transparent disclosure is both the ethical approach and the smart business approach. We provide full disclosure-ready metadata with every image, and we've found that consumers respond positively to brands that are upfront about using technology to improve their products and marketing.

Happy to discuss further. What questions do you have?

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply with questions or approval to proceed
**Purpose:** Deliver the proposal and proactively address their biggest hesitation.

---

### Email 3 — Day 7: Objection Pre-emption

**Subject:** The question most brands ask at this stage
**Preview text:** Addressing the hesitation before it becomes a blocker.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

At this point in the conversation, most marketing leaders ask some version of the same question: "What if our audience doesn't respond well to AI-generated imagery?"

It's the right question. Here's how we think about it:

First, the quality threshold has crossed the point where consumers can reliably distinguish AI-generated lifestyle imagery from traditional photography. This is especially true in baby product imagery, where the focus is on the product in context rather than on individual talent recognition.

Second, the pilot is specifically designed to test this. You're not committing to replacing your entire imagery pipeline. You're producing a small batch of images, deploying them on a few listings or campaigns, and measuring the results. If engagement or conversion dips, you have clear data. If it improves (which is what we've consistently seen), you have a confident path to scale.

Third, the risk of not testing is real too. Brands that wait for perfect certainty before adopting new production methods don't get certainty — they get passed by competitors who tested first.

The pilot is designed to be a low-risk way to generate real data for your team. Would it be helpful to walk through the pilot timeline together this week?

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Schedule follow-up to finalize pilot
**Purpose:** Address the most common post-demo hesitation head-on. Reframe risk.

### Email 4 — Day 14: Decision Support

**Subject:** What would help you move forward?
**Preview text:** Happy to support however is most useful.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to check in. I know decisions like this involve multiple stakeholders and competing priorities, and I don't want to add pressure where it isn't helpful.

That said, I'd like to be useful. If any of these would help move things forward, just let me know:

- **Internal presentation:** I can put together a brief deck your team can review internally — tailored to [Company Name]'s use case and the pilot scope we discussed.
- **Technical Q&A:** If your team has specific questions about AI governance, disclosure requirements, or integration with your existing workflow, I'm happy to schedule a focused call.
- **Adjusted scope:** If the pilot scope feels too large (or too small), we can adjust. The goal is to find the right starting point for your team.
- **Reference conversation:** I can connect you with another marketing leader who has gone through the evaluation process, if hearing from a peer would be helpful.

And if the timing just isn't right, that's genuinely fine. I'd rather stay in touch and start when the moment is right than push for a forced timeline.

What would be most helpful?

[Founder Name]

**CTA:** Reply with what would help
**Purpose:** Low-pressure, high-support. Give them multiple paths forward. Demonstrate patience and flexibility.

**Body:**

Either way, I wish you and the [Company Name] team well.

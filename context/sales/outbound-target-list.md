# Outbound Target List & Targeting Strategy

## Overview

This document defines babystudio's outbound prospecting strategy: who we target, why, and how we prioritize. Every outbound motion — cold email, LinkedIn outreach, event follow-up, partner introduction — starts here.

**Purpose:** Build a structured, repeatable pipeline by focusing sales effort on companies most likely to buy, most likely to succeed with our product, and most likely to become references.

**How targeting drives pipeline:**

1. **Focus over volume.** We contact fewer companies with higher relevance rather than blasting generic lists.
2. **Research before outreach.** Every prospect gets 15-30 minutes of research before a single message is sent.
3. **Segment-specific messaging.** Enterprise, DTC, and agency prospects each receive tailored value propositions.
4. **Scoring gates action.** Only prospects scoring above threshold enter active outreach sequences.

Update this document monthly. Add new targets as they emerge. Remove or deprioritize targets that disqualify. This is a living pipeline tool, not a static reference.

## Enterprise Target Criteria

Enterprise prospects represent our highest-value segment. These are large organizations where a single contract can generate $50K-$200K+ annually and where a successful deployment becomes an industry reference.

### Must-Have Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Baby category revenue | $500M+ (or $100M+ with strong growth) | Ensures imagery volume justifies enterprise pricing |
| Baby product lines | 3+ distinct lines or brands | Multiple lines = multiple use cases = larger contract |
| E-commerce presence | Active Amazon, DTC, or both | E-commerce demands high-volume, fast-turnaround imagery |
| Geographic breadth | Sells in 3+ markets | Multi-market = localization needs = higher value per customer |

### Strong-Signal Criteria

| Signal | Where to Find It | What It Indicates |
|---|---|---|
| AI/digital transformation mentions | Press releases, annual reports, LinkedIn posts from leadership | Organizational openness to AI solutions |
| Job postings for content/creative roles | LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, company careers page | Active content production pain; growing team = growing need |
| Recent market expansion | Press releases, SEC filings, trade publications | New markets = new imagery needs (localization, demographic variation) |
| Product launch cadence | Amazon new listings, press releases, social media | High launch velocity = recurring imagery demand |
| Expiring talent contracts | Industry knowledge, 12-month cycle assumption | Natural re-evaluation window for imagery sourcing |
| Agency churn or RFP activity | Trade publications, LinkedIn signals | Dissatisfaction with current production = openness to alternatives |

### Disqualifiers

- No baby/infant product lines (children 5+ only does not qualify)
- Exclusively brick-and-mortar with no digital content needs
- Active public stance against AI-generated content (approach later as market shifts)
- Currently in litigation related to child imagery (reputational risk)

---

## DTC Target Criteria

DTC and emerging brands are our velocity segment. Shorter sales cycles, smaller deal sizes, but faster to close and high potential for word-of-mouth referrals within tight founder networks.

### Must-Have Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Funding stage or revenue | Series A+ or $5M+ annual revenue | Ensures budget exists for professional imagery |
| Product-market fit signals | Growing reviews, expanding SKUs, repeat purchase indicators | Brand is investing in growth, not just survival |
| Baby/infant focus | Core product line serves 0-3 age range | Our AI talent and governance are built for infant imagery |

### Strong-Signal Criteria

| Signal | Where to Find It | What It Indicates |
|---|---|---|
| Imagery quality gaps | Product-only Amazon listings, stock photos on website, inconsistent brand imagery | Clear pain point we solve immediately |
| Growth rate indicators | Crunchbase funding data, SimilarWeb traffic trends, Amazon BSR movement | Growing brand = growing content needs |
| Founder active on LinkedIn/Twitter | Social media presence | Reachable decision-maker, likely to engage with thought leadership |
| Recent funding round | Crunchbase, TechCrunch, press releases | Fresh capital often allocated to brand building |
| Expanding to new channels | New Amazon listings, Walmart.com, Target.com, DTC launch | Channel expansion requires new imagery formats |
| Hiring marketing roles | LinkedIn Jobs, AngelList | Investing in marketing = investing in content |

### Disqualifiers

- Pre-revenue with no funding (cannot afford professional imagery)
- Product is not baby/infant-specific
- Brand aesthetic is exclusively photography-purist (stated anti-AI position)

---

## Agency Target Criteria

Agencies are our partnership and channel segment. A single agency relationship can unlock 5-20 brand clients. We approach them as collaborators, not customers.

### Must-Have Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Baby brand clients in portfolio | 2+ current baby/infant brand clients | Validates they have the client base we serve |
| Production capabilities | In-house or managed production for clients | They understand production pain firsthand |
| Size | 50+ employees | Indicates scale and budget authority for new vendor relationships |

### Strong-Signal Criteria

| Signal | Where to Find It | What It Indicates |
|---|---|---|
| Innovation positioning | Website messaging, case studies, awards submissions | Agencies that lead with innovation will adopt AI imagery first |
| Content production volume | Portfolio depth, social media output for clients | High volume = high pain = high value |
| Creative director accessible | LinkedIn, agency website, speaking engagements | Reachable champion who can advocate internally |
| Recent baby brand win | Press releases, AdAge, trade publications | New client = new production needs = natural entry point |

### Disqualifiers

- No baby/child brand clients
- Boutique shop under 10 employees (limited scale)
- Exclusively strategy/media (no production involvement)

| **Timing Signals** | 2x | No triggers detected | Moderate triggers (growth, expansion) | Strong triggers (product launch, funding, vendor change) |
| **Accessibility** | 2x | No contacts found, complex org | Some contacts, standard procurement | Champion identified, warm intro possible, direct access |

### Action Thresholds

## Research Checklist Before Outreach

Complete this checklist for every prospect before sending the first outreach message. Invest 15-30 minutes per prospect. Personalized outreach dramatically outperforms generic.

1. **Company overview:** What does the company do? What are their baby product lines? What is their market position?
2. **Recent news:** Any product launches, expansions, funding rounds, leadership changes, or strategic announcements in the past 6 months?
3. **Current imagery audit:** Review their website, Amazon listings, and social media. What does their baby product imagery look like today? Stock? Professional? Product-only? Lifestyle?
4. **Content volume:** How many SKUs? How many Amazon listings? How frequently do they publish new content?
5. **Contact identification:** Who is the decision-maker? Who is the likely champion? Are they active on LinkedIn?
6. **Technology signals:** Does the company discuss AI, digital transformation, or innovation publicly? Any AI-related job postings?
7. **Competitive context:** What are their direct competitors doing with imagery? Anyone using AI-generated content?
8. **Pain indicators:** Any job postings for creative/content roles? Agency RFPs? Public complaints about production timelines?
9. **Relationship mapping:** Do we have any warm connections? Shared LinkedIn contacts? Past interactions? Event co-attendance?
10. **Potential objection inventory:** What is this specific company most likely to push back on? (AI skepticism, brand control, regulatory concerns, internal politics)

## Outreach Cadence by Segment

### Enterprise (VP Marketing "Enterprise Emma")

Enterprise outreach is a marathon, not a sprint. Multi-threaded, multi-channel, patience-first.

| Touch | Day | Channel | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 1 | Email | Personalized cold email referencing specific imagery pain point from research |
| 2 | Day 2 | LinkedIn | Connection request with brief personalized note (no pitch) |
| 3 | Day 5 | Email | Follow-up with relevant content piece (blog post, report) |
| 4 | Day 8 | LinkedIn | Engage with their content (like, thoughtful comment) |
| 5 | Day 12 | Email | Share industry insight specific to their category |
| 6 | Day 16 | Phone/VM | Brief voicemail referencing emails, offer 15-minute call |
| 7 | Day 22 | Email | Case study or ROI comparison relevant to their segment |
| 8 | Day 30 | LinkedIn | Direct message referencing prior touchpoints |
| 9 | Day 40 | Email | Final outreach — direct, low-pressure, leave door open |

**Rules:** Never send more than 2 emails in a single week. Personalize every touch. If they engage at any point, transition to direct conversation. Multi-thread by reaching the champion AND a secondary contact.

### DTC (Founder "Startup Sam")

DTC outreach is direct, fast, and value-forward. Founders respect efficiency.

| Touch | Day | Channel | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 1 | Email | Short, direct cold email. Lead with their specific imagery gap. |
| 2 | Day 3 | LinkedIn | Connection request + brief message |
| 3 | Day 5 | Email | Before/after sample or link to relevant content |
| 4 | Day 9 | Email | Pilot pack offer with clear pricing |
| 5 | Day 14 | Email/LinkedIn | Final touch — offer sample pack, leave door open |

**Rules:** Keep emails under 150 words. Lead with value, not credentials. Mention specific products or listings you reviewed. Offer something tangible (sample pack) by touch 4.

### Agency (Creative Director "Agency Alex")

Agency outreach is relationship-first. Position as a production capability, not a vendor pitch.

| Touch | Day | Channel | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 1 | LinkedIn | Connection request with note about their baby brand work |
| 2 | Day 5 | Email | Introduction email framing babystudio as production partner |
| 3 | Day 10 | LinkedIn | Share/comment on their creative work |
| 4 | Day 15 | Email | Offer to do a sample project for one of their baby brand clients |
| 5 | Day 25 | Email | Follow-up with case study relevant to agency model |
| 6 | Day 40 | LinkedIn/Email | Soft close — suggest an exploratory call |

**Rules:** Never position as replacing their creative work. Frame as extending their production capabilities. Reference specific client work. Offer to make them look good to their clients.

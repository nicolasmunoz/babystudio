# Case Study Skill

Create case studies from customer engagements or hypothetical scenarios.

## When to Use

When a customer engagement produces results worth documenting, or when creating sample case studies to demonstrate capability.

## Prerequisites

- Case study template exists (`/context/sales/case-study-template.md`)
- Messaging framework exists (`/context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`)
- Brand guidelines exist (`/context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`)

## Process

1. Load context: case-study-template.md, messaging-framework.md, brand-guidelines.md
2. Gather inputs (customer context, challenge, solution details, results)
3. Follow template structure (Challenge → Solution → Results)
4. Apply brand voice
5. Include quantified results where possible
6. Create versions for different formats (see below)
7. Save to `/outputs/sales/case-studies/`

## Case Study Structure

```markdown
# [Customer Type]: [Key Result Headline]

## At a Glance
- **Industry:** [Baby products, CPG, DTC, etc.]
- **Company Size:** [Revenue range or employee count]
- **Challenge:** [One-sentence summary]
- **Result:** [Key metric or outcome]

## The Challenge
[2-3 paragraphs describing the customer's situation, pain points, and what they tried before]

## The Solution
[2-3 paragraphs on how babystudio addressed the challenge, what the process looked like, specific capabilities used]

## The Results
[Quantified outcomes with before/after comparison]
- [Metric 1]: [Before] → [After]
- [Metric 2]: [Before] → [After]
- [Metric 3]: [Before] → [After]

## Key Takeaway
[One-paragraph summary of why this matters for similar companies]

## What They Said

> — [Name, Title, Company]
```

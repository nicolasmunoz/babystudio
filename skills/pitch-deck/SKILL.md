# Pitch Deck Skill

Generate pitch deck content following messaging framework and sales enablement materials.

## When to Use

When CMO needs to create or update pitch deck content for enterprise or DTC presentations.

## Prerequisites

- Messaging framework exists (`/context/marketing/messaging-framework.md`)
- Brand guidelines exist (`/context/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`)
- Target market defined (`/context/company/target-market.md`)
- Competitive landscape mapped (`/context/company/competitive-landscape.md`)
- Business model documented (`/context/company/business-model.md`)

## Process

1. Load context: messaging-framework.md, brand-guidelines.md, target-market.md, competitive-landscape.md, business-model.md
2. Select deck version (enterprise or emerging brand)
3. Follow slide structure (see below)
4. Draft slide content and speaker notes
5. Apply persona-specific messaging
6. Include proof points and competitive differentiation
7. Save to `/outputs/sales/`

## Slide Structure

### Enterprise Version (12-15 slides)

1. **Title** — Company name, tagline, presenter info
2. **The Problem** — Baby product brands need infant imagery but traditional production is slow, expensive, and constrained
3. **The Cost** — Quantify the pain: production costs, timelines, compliance overhead, localization costs
4. **The Shift** — Market is moving toward AI-generated content; baby brands are uniquely underserved
5. **Our Solution** — babystudio: AI-generated infant talent with compliance-first production
6. **How It Works** — Step-by-step process from brief to delivered assets
7. **Differentiation** — Why babystudio vs. general AI tools, stock, or traditional production
8. **Results / Proof** — Sample work, metrics, comparisons (traditional vs. AI production)
9. **Compliance & Trust** — Safety standards, governance, disclosure framework
10. **Pricing** — ROI comparison, pricing tiers (reference pricing-framework.md)
11. **About Us** — Team, mission, vision
12. **Next Steps** — Clear CTA (pilot project, demo, meeting)
13. **Appendix** — Detailed proof points, FAQ, technical details

### Emerging Brand Version (8-10 slides)

1. **Title** — Company name, tagline
2. **Your Challenge** — Growing brands need professional baby imagery but can't afford traditional shoots
3. **Our Solution** — AI-generated infant talent at a fraction of the cost
4. **How It Works** — Simple 3-step process
5. **Before & After** — Traditional production vs. babystudio (cost, speed, control)
6. **Sample Work** — Portfolio of generated imagery
7. **Pricing** — Transparent, accessible pricing
8. **Next Steps** — Clear CTA (trial project, demo)

## Speaker Notes Format

For each slide, include:
- **Key point** (what to emphasize)
- **Transition** (how to move to next slide)
- **Objection prep** (likely question and response)
